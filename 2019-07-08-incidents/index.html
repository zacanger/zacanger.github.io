# incidents

# goals

* fast MTTD (mean time to detection)
* high MTTF (mean time to failure) (uptime)
* high MTBF (mean time between failures)
* low MTTF (mean time to recovery)

---

# goals

* less panic
* less people doing things all at once
* more coordination
* more (and clearer) communication

---

# roles

```
            --------------------
            |Incident Commander|
            --------------------
                /        \
               /          \
      [Tech Lead]        [Communications Lead]

```

---

# incident commander

* does not fix the problem (but has some knowledge of the system)
* keeps up to date with everything that's going on
* handles internal (engineering) communication

---

# tech lead

* fixes the problem
* keeps incident commander updated
* runs major changes by the IC

---

# communications lead

* external communications (link to marketing, CxOs, etc)
* keeps IC updated with what stakeholders/customers are saying

---

# severity

if everything is a P0, nothing is a P0

---

# severity

0. everything is on fire oh god
  * maybe multiple engineers under tech lead
  * communications lead necessary
1. one thing is kinda on fire
  * one engineer
  * maybe no communications lead
2. something looks like it might catch fire soon
  * not really an incident
3. look at this sometime next sprint
  * definitely not an incident

---

# how can we do this?

---

# games!

* chaos engineering
  * simian army (chaos monkey)
  * i could just kill stuff in prod
* bad prd releases
* bad stg releases

---

# tools!

* victorops (on call should matter!)
* newrelic (we pay them a lot of money, let's use them better!)
* logging (sumologic -> efk)
* chatops (we all live in slack anyway)
* documentation (how should incident reports work? runbooks?)

---

# training!

* not just on the tools
* cross-training
  * limit the bus factor

---

# restrictions!

if there's only one process for making changes in production, no one has to
wonder if they're doing it right.

* no access to boxes in prod
* no changes through the AWS console or CLI
* everything goes through CI (including DB changes)
  * services
  * db
  * infrastructure (terraform, kubernetes)
