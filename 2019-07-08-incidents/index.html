# incidents

---

# goals

* fast MTTD (mean time to detection)
* high MTTF (mean time to failure) (uptime)
* high MTBF (mean time between failures)
* low MTTF (mean time to recovery)

---

# goals

* less panic
* less people doing things all at once
* more coordination
* more (and clearer) communication

---

# roles

```
            --------------------
            |Incident Commander|
            --------------------
                /        \
               /          \
      [Tech Lead]        [Communications Lead]

```

---

# incident commander

* does not fix the problem (but has some knowledge of the system)
* keeps up to date with everything that's going on
* handles internal (engineering) communication

---

# tech lead

* fixes the problem
* keeps incident commander updated
* runs major changes by the IC

---

# communications lead

* external communications (link to marketing, CxOs, etc)
* keeps IC updated with what stakeholders/customers are saying

---

# severity

if everything is a P0, nothing is a P0

---

# severity

* **P0** everything is on fire oh god
  * maybe multiple engineers under tech lead
  * communications lead necessary
* **P1** one thing is on fire
  * maybe just tech lead on engineering
  * communications lead necessary if customers/stakeholders affected
* **P2** something looks like it might catch fire soon
  * probably no incident commander or communicatoins lead
* **P3** look at this sometime next sprint
  * definitely not an incident

---

# how can we do this?

---

# games!

* chaos engineering
  * simian army (chaos monkey)
  * i could just kill stuff in prod
* bad prd releases
* bad stg releases

---

# tools!

* victorops (on call should matter!)
* newrelic (we pay them a lot of money, let's use them better!)
* logging (sumologic -> efk)
* chatops (we all live in slack anyway)
* documentation (how should incident reports work? runbooks?)

---

# training!

* not just on the tools
* cross-training
  * limit the bus factor

---

# restrictions!

if there's only one process for making changes in production, no one has to
wonder if they're doing it right.

* no access to boxes in prod
* no changes through the AWS console or CLI
* everything goes through CI
  * services
  * client applications
  * db
  * infrastructure (terraform, kubernetes)
* no cheating (if the tests don't pass, it doesn't go out)
  * having 0 tests and a green build doesn't count

---

# less incidents!

* better autoscaling
* better CI/CD process
* move pieces to different layers (example: rate limiting close to the edge)
* circuit breakers

---

# less "incidents!"

* if it will self correct (scaling)
* if it has nothing to do with us and we can't fix it (someone on IE 8)
* if it's an exception we can just expect to happen sometimes

### _then it's not an incident_

---

# takeaways

we don't suck!

but we could be better
