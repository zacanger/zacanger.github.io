I've wanted to do something like this for a while (since December-ish), but
haven't had the time. I have some minor design experience (not a lot), and tend
to read more about interaction design, HCI, and other random
non-programming-but-still-computer-and-person-working-together-related topics
than I do about programming.

Would anyone be interested in seeing something like that? This is a short list
of things I might cover:

* A11Y
* Typography
* Colour theory
* Whitespace
* Scalable design (math; see Basscss)
* Styleguides (writing, maintaining, conforming)
* Image manipulation (mostly what _not_ to do)
* Importance and longevity of simplicity
* KISS
* [Principles](http://jxnblk.com/principles/)

Please [tweet at me](https://twitter.com/@zacanger) if you think you'd be into
it, or have any suggestions/additions/whatever.
