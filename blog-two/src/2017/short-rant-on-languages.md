I wrote this on [Mastodon](https://mastodon.social/@zacanger) but decided
to cross-post for whatever reason.

One of my biggest pet peeves is when people talk about how great foo-lang is as
an alernative to bar-lang, & it turns out they're just shit at bar-lang, or
write deliberately bad bar-lang in examples to try to make foo-lang look better.
Don't do that. If you can't write decent, idiomatic bar-lang, you don't get to
hate it yet. If you _can_ and are writing it like someone who's never read a
tutorial on it intentionally, you're just making foo-lang's community look like
assholes.  Chances are foo-lang is pretty great, & can stand up on its own
merits. Talk about those, not how bad your half-assed bar-lang is in comparison.
I see this a lot with functional languages that compile to JS, especially, &
it's sad, because most of those languages are actually really neat & there are a
lot of good reasons to try them, but people saying 'look how horrible this JS is
compared to this other thing' when the JS looks like it was written by someone
who skimmed a jQuery tutorial once _really_ doesn't present the community very
well. So don't do that.

Also: a fun vim/Twitter trick (I also cross-posted this to
[Twitter](https://twitter.com/zacanger) ): `:set textwidth=140`, then `gq`.
You're welcome.
