Effective Websites

Some traits of effective websites:

* Designed around the objectives of the _users_, not the designers or developers
  * (Also not necessarily the person/company the website represents!)
* _Refined_ feel
  * This is really vague, but the site should _feel_ clean and elegant
* USER FRIENDLINESS ABOVE ALL ELSE.
  * Easy to navigate
  * Stress-free
  * Understandable
* Easy to keep current
  * This means making it extraordinarily simple for clients to add/change content
  * This also means keeping everything both _modular_ and _separated_, so things like assets, styles, or entire sections can be swapped out easily.
* A11Y. Just do it.
* i18n, and (if needed) i10n.
