Electron and NW.js

Electron (formerly known as Atom Shell) and NW.js (formerly known as Node Webkit) are similar projects that bring Javascript to the desktop. They're both based on browser runtimes. Electron is sponsored by Github, and uses libchromiumcontent and Webkit 537 (as of Autumn 2015). NW.js is sponsored by Intel and uses Chromium and Blink/Webkit 537. They both use the V8 JS engine (from Chrome), are fully open source (MIT Licensed), can access a variety of open and licensed codecs, work on Unix-like systems (and, with a little extra work, on Windows), and can use Flash (in Electron's case, through the Pepper plugin). The biggest difference I've had in working with them is that Electron, being currently more popular (likely because of the Github support, and the popularity of the Atom editor, which is built on Electron) is usually closer to the current version of Chromium, and NW.js is usually a few versions behind. Electron seems to have a lot more community activity around it right now, too, so there are a lot of useful NPM packages like [Electron-Prebuilt](https://www.npmjs.com/package/electron-prebuilt) (and [a lite version](https://www.npmjs.com/package/electron-prebuilt-lite)) and [Electron-Packager](https://www.npmjs.com/package/electron-packager) (and [an interactive version!](https://www.npmjs.com/package/electron-packager-interactive)). Electron also needs a Javascript entry point, which looks something like this:

    var app           = require('app')  
      , BrowserWindow = require('browser-window')  
    require('crash-reporter').start()  

    var mainWindow = null  

    app.on('window-all-closed', function(){  
      if(process.platform != 'darwin'){  
          app.quit()  
      }  
    })  
    app.on('ready', function(){  
      mainWindow = new BrowserWindow({  
        width                : 1200  
      , height               : 800  
      , 'accept-first-mouse' : true  
      , 'title-bar-style'    : 'hidden'  
      , 'node-integration'   : false  
      })  
      mainWindow.loadUrl('http://127.0.0.1:9090')  
      mainWindow.on('closed', function(){  
        mainWindow = null  
      })  
    })  

That 'node-integration' line is _really important_ if you want to use certain client-side libraries like Angular or jQuery that use the word 'module;' your stuff will just completely break without it.

NW.js, on the other hand, can just be pointed at your `index.html`, and that's enough to get started. That's really convenient, but for my own uses I've found that Electron has a lot more options. Its binaries are significantly larger, but there are evidently ways to cut them down. Don't count on being able to build an Electron app in less than a hundred megs, though.

If you're doing something small, like a text editor or some other little widgety kind of app, you'd probably still be better off with Qt or GTK--you can write a full text editor in GTK-Webkit with Python in less than 16kb, and that's if need a full rich-text interface with buttons and such. But for larger apps, and especially for apps you've already written for the browser, NW.js and Electron are both really great options. If you're going to be relying on a lot of the Node environment, Electron's got a better interface to Node because of its separated rendering and browser engines, but you do have to keep in mind that you'll be limited as to what client-side libraries you can use.
