<p>Performance matters. That's just a thing. I really don't care all that much about the browser-side stuff, personally,
and I'm a wee bit sick of a lot of the client-side frameworks that have most of the market, because they mean you
really <em>have</em> to care about using a lot of JS in the browser... because that's where you're doing most of the work.
Things like Angular really show off this kind of horrible way of building apps. Putting all the work in every person's
browser sure makes a lot of sense if you've got one tiny SPA and you're serving it from a home netbook or whatever...
but come on, people. Stop hurting users. Be realistic. It's not even about doing what's probably actually the <em>right</em>
thing to do... it can, if you want, just be about the dollar. Users don't want to wait. No one wants to wait. Sending
out a whole bunch of scripts to a three-year-old knockoff tablet from China that's running on DSL out in the country
and then figuring that user is okay with waiting while their device slowly loads it all in and slooowly runs the
scripts and then finally starts showing them the goddamn site they're trying to see... that's how you lose people.
There are truckloads of studies out there about the negative impact of every millisecond, so I won't keep rambling, and
will start getting down to some note-taking and summarizing.... Oh, right. I'm reading through
<a href="https://browserdiet.com/en/">this little guide</a>, right now, so that's what sparked this. I know I've read it before,
but I'm really hardcore procrastinating learning Redux right now, so I figured I'd do something else. This is actually
in my school notes directory, but it may end up as a blog post. Certainly sounds like it. Who knows?</p>
<hr />
<p>The sort of traditional-ish 'best practice' thing to do is to never use inline styles/scripts
(<code>&lt;div style="stuff:things;" onClick="doThis"&gt;</code>), though there are use cases for it. For sites with just a very small
amount of styles/scripts, you could embed (<code>&lt;style&gt;</code> and <code>&lt;script&gt;</code> tags). But all-around it's best to keep everything
separated out, at least when you're working. Build tools can always inline things later for you, if you need this.
Do keep in mind that latency is <em>far</em> more important that size, so if you can lower the amount of requests you're
making in any way, fucking do it.</p>
<p>Styles in the <code>&lt;head&gt;</code>, traditionally scripts down at the bottom of the body, although if you're doing all of your
rendering in the client, firstly, shame on you, but also, stick your scripts up top, because otherwise no one will see
<em>anything</em> until your JS is all loaded. We usually throw CSS up top because designers would hate to for anyone to see
the site without their painstakingly-chosen font pairings, even just for a flash. Use <code>async</code> in your script tags
(<code>&lt;script async src="./foo.js"</code>), when you can (keep in mind that they'll all be executed in no particular order, so if
using <code>async</code> you can't rely on dependency chains--which you shouldn't be doing anyway).</p>
<p>Minify everything. That's just a given. Also a given, but I'll say it here anyway: <em><strong>don't try to minify your goddamn
markup</strong></em>. Yes, people do that. Yes, it can be done, a little bit. It's not worth the trouble. It barely works.
It frequently just <em>doesn't</em> work. So give up on that. Markup renders super fuckin' fast. HTML isn't slowing down your
page; the two-dozen requests and the browser-side routing are slowing down your page. Along with
minification/uglification(/obfuscation), obviously you'll want to bundle. Again, build tools make this really easy.</p>
<p>On that note, don't use <code>@import url('bar.css');</code> in production code. Browsers can download <code>&lt;style&gt;</code> tags in
in parallel, but not <code>@import</code>s (and only so many tags in in parallel, which is why you should bundle). Build tools,
build tools, build tools.</p>
<p>For third-party code, <em>load asynchronously</em>. Or use iframes like your grandfather, I don't care. Or you could do
	something like this:
	<br>
<code>javascript
(function(){
  var script,
      scripts = document.getElementsByTagName('script')[0]
  function load(url){
    script = document.createElement('script')
    script.async = true
    script.src = url
    scripts.parentNode.insertBefore(script, scripts)
  }
  load('//example.url/quux.js')
  load('//another.one/baz.js')
	}())</code>
<br>
if you want. Or you could just not be all about them external scripts. Totally up to you.</p>
<p>Oh, and on that note, if you're using jQuery (which you are, admit it, you goon), do <em>try</em> to get the latest one.
They do actually keep that updated and worked on and are usually actually optimizing it and making it better. Though
you should keep in mind that there <em>are</em> some breaking changes (especially right now, what with jQuery 1.x still in
use in a lot of places, the 2.1.x being super common, and 3.0.0-alpha currently out--though they did a <strong>great</strong> job
of breaking as little as they possibly could, that's for sure).</p>
<p>If legacy browsers (read: Safari, IEanything, Mozilla pre-mid-30s) are a concern, optimize your loops (modern browsers
do this automatically). One big help would be to store the size of arrays, so the JS engine doesn't have to
recalculate this every time it runs through the loop. Here's how that'd be done:<br>
<code>javascript
var i, len,
    arr = new Array(42)
for (i = 0, len = arr.length; i &lt; len; i++){
  // do stuff
	}</code><br>
This would also help in a situation where, inside your loop, you're working with a <code>NodeList</code>. It just helps to have
a limit set before your for loop, so you don't wind up doing an infinite loop, for example appending something that
you're maybe also using as the constraint for your loop, or whatever.</p>
<p><code>document.write</code> is really not even worth mentioning, but I will mention it anyway. Don't do it. Just don't. It's bad.
It's not the worst thing you could ever do in Javascript, but it's also definitely not a good thing to do. Especially
don't ever do it inside (or after) a <code>window.onload</code>, unless you want everything on your page replaced.</p>
<p>Repaints: avoid, if you can. That's a non-layout style change (like a colour, for example). Reflows: avoid even more.
That'd be a layout change (like the height or width of an element). If you need to change these things, collect all
the data you'll be using <em>before</em> changing anything, that way you can do it all at once and the browser can just go
ahead and re-render it all <em>once</em>.</p>
<p>The DOM is the devil. Okay, no, not really, and even if it was, we'd still have to mess with it, because we're dealing
with Javascript, here, and we're specifically talking about front-end performance, so...</p>
<p>Really, though, as we did in the example near the top (the array thing), try to store (cache? whatever, pick a word,
I don't care...) the bit you're acting on, so you don't need to query the DOM constantly (if you're doing something
a lot, I mean). <code>for (var i = 0; i &lt; 100; i++){document.getElementById("thingy")blahblahblah}</code> is not really okay at
all; <code>var stuff = document.getElementById("thingy"); for (var i = 0; i &lt; 100; i++){stuff += things or whatever}</code> is
a good sight better, don'tcha think? Javascript isn't a slow language. If it was slow, I probably wouldn't like it
all that much, and as it happens, I'm starting to grow fond of it. The <em>DOM</em> is slow. There's so much going on up in
there, all the time, a truly <em>insane</em> amount of stuff that most people never even have to think about. So think about
that for a minute next time you go to mess with the DOM. It's gonna go all old-lady-crossing-the-road on yo ass.</p>
<p>Ugh, jQuery. I know, shut up, okay. I use it too. Kinda have to. Everything depends on it. Like, every framework,
basically. And also the stability of the earth's rotation. And life, and probably death, too. Okay. So when you're
using it (which is right now, I bet), using <code>$("#thing")</code> is gonna be faster than using classes or elements (or shit
like <code>children()</code>). Of course, that means you're doing things with IDs, which means maybe causing specificity issues
down the road in your CSS, but screw it, there's always <code>!important</code>, or total refactoring. (I jest. Using IDs is
faster, and the specificity issue won't <em>be</em> an issue unless you make it one.)</p>
<p>On the topics of jQuery and loops (which is the topic that we're on now, by the way), <code>jQuery.each</code> is slow.
<code>for...in</code> is slower. Reverse for and while loops are actually faster(est? fasterest?), but because they're
super-duper annoying-as-BALLS, don't use them.</p>
<p>And don't be afraid to just use regular old Javascript for things that you might usually grab jQuery to handle. As it
happens, you can do a <em>lot</em> of things in vanilla JS these days, without needing to reach for the <code>$()</code>. Just know
what tools you should be using, I guess; don't stick with with a tool out of habit long after there's any need for
it, but don't be afraid of using that tool if nothing else will do the job as efficiently, all around. That's said
a lot, especially in our industry ('Use the right tool for the job'), but definitely still isn't said enough.</p>
<p>Optimize how you handle images. That doesn't just mean shrinking your photos down to size--there are other things you
can do to speed up image loading. CSS sprites are kind of obnoxious to work with, but if you have a lot of small
items (say, icons, or toolbar buttons, or something), you'll save yourself a double-handful or more HTTP requests
right there. Another option would be data URIs. Again, annoying as crap, and you wouldn't want to handle any large
images this way, but for small items you can just do something like
<code>.little-tiny-img { background-image: url('data:image/png;base64,reallylongassstringofrandomalphanumericcharacters')}</code>
and save yourself a request there.</p>
<p>As for your actual images, you're definitely best off using (can you guess what I'm going to say?) a <em>build tool</em>.
Or just any tool, really. This isn't something it's at all reasonable to do manually, so find a tool you like that
will remove the metadata, embedded thumbnails, etc., and then figure out if you want to compress your image as well;
that'll bring down the actual image quality, but as it happens, most screens don't display images at an insanely
high resolution anyway.</p>
<p>That's just about it, I think. Requests matter a lot, probably more than file size, unless your files are huge. If
your files are huge, make them not huge. Vanilla JS is usually faster than jQuery, but definitely not always.
Messing with the DOM is slow, especially if you're doing so manually (or with jQuery). There are good reasons for
libraries and frameworks like React, Vue, Riot, and Mithril. Don't be wary of using a solution, if it's the right
solution for the problem. Don't go looking for a problem, just because you have a solution.</p>
<p>Learn a build tool. Learn more than one. Webpack and Browserify are fantastic tools for front-end development. Gulp
is definitely where you should be, on the back end (in my personal, sometimes humble opinion). Grunt is a pain, and
is kind of unfashionable these days anyway.</p>
<p>Test things. If there are bottlenecks, find them and fix them. Here are some links for website performance testing
tools:</p>

<p>That's all. Okay. Done.</p>
<p>Go away now.</p>
<p>Byeeee.</p>
