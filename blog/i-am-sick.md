I AM SICK

I really hate being sick. I turn into a whiny annoying bitching asshole. And this time I'm even more of all of those things because it was one specific person (guess who) who got us sick (us being the rest of the apartment). I mean, look. I'm not racist, buuutt (yes, here it comes)... this little kid could easily make me racist.

Okay, no, not really. But goddamn I just hate being sick. I slept for 18 hours, and missed basically two days of school, and he things it's amusing....

FUCK.
