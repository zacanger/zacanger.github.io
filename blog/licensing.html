<p>I just wanted to take a moment to say that I don't actually care even the slightest bit if someone is offended by some things that I might say, especially if those things are as basic and trivial as the word 'fuck.' This was brought up recently, because my <a href="http://zacanger.com/whateverrandomblablahblah">error page</a> happens to be 'rude' and 'unprofessional.' (<em>Note: I agree. It's very unprofessional to use Internet Explorer, and to interrupt someone at work to criticize something on their website completely unrelated to any client project and ask them to remove it. Also, it's not a very nice error page.</em>) </p>

<hr />

<p>Look, I really don't care. <em>Fuck</em> isn't a particularly nasty word. It's not a slur, it's not demeaning, it's not a word used specifically to marginalize or hurt any individual people or groups thereof. So fuck you.</p>

<p>This relates to licenses only in that I usually opt for the <a href="http://wtfpl.net">WTFPL</a> over other free licenses. Maybe it's kind of offensive to some, but there's actually a valid reason for that. Following is the full text of the license.</p>

<pre><code>DO WHAT THE FUCK YOU WANT TO PUBLIC LICENSE 
Version 2, December 2004                      
Copyright (C) 2004 Sam Hocevar &lt;sam@hocevar.net&gt;  
Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim or modified 
copies of this license document, and changing it is allowed as long

TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION       
0. You just DO WHAT THE FUCK YOU WANT TO.
</code></pre>

<p>And here's a paragraph from the <a href="http://www.wtfpl.net/faq/">FAQ</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>But profanity is offensive!</strong></p>
  
  <p>You know what? Fuck your stance on profanity. Fuck your priorities in life.
  The WTFPL is about fucking freedom and we mean it. Freedom means freedom to
  copy and modify and share works of art and science with the rest of mankind,
  but also freedom to be gay and marry and have crazy gay sex, freedom to have
  tattoos, freedom to say there is no God, freedom to take the pill, freedom
  to have an abortion. People die for being gay or atheists. Don’t tell me that
  there is something sacred enough that it must be protected from the mere
  existence of the word “fuck”. If the F in WTFPL offends you, then fuck you
  and your beliefs.
  Triple fuck you.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So... that's pretty clear now, yes?</p>
