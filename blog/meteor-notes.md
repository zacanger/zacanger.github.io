Meteor Notes

## General Notes, from that time I played with Meteor

`{{#with foo}}` is a template tag that takes arg (foo). that is the _data context_ for the block in that tag. being a _tag_, it needs to be closed later (`{/with}`).

{{#each}} also takes an argument, usually a 'cursor' such as the result of `Collection.find()`.

Includes are like so: `{{> foo bar}}` which will bring in the bar from foo.

meteor's blaze will soon just be a thin templating layer over react.

iron router is meteor's primary routing package. its 'data' method helps with data contexts.

in meteor there are html _templates_ and js _template helpers_, in which data context is accessible via `this`. an example:

    <template name="profile">
      <h3>profile</h3>
      {{#with profile}}
      <img src="{{avatarPath}}" />
      {{#with name}}
      <p>{{fullName}}</p>
      {{/with}}
      {{/with}}
    </template>


    Template.profile.helpers({
      profile: function(){
        return Users.findOne(Session.get('userId'))
      },
      avatarPath: function(){
        return 'images/' + this.avatar
      },
      fullName: function(){
        return this.first + ' ' +  this.last
      }
    })

a dedicated {{log}} helper can be more useful than console.log(this)

    Template.profile.helpers({
      log: function(){
        console.log(this)
    }})


    <template name="profile">
      {{#with profile}}
      {{log}}
      <!-- etc -->
      {{/with}}


the `..` keyword in helpers is to access a parent. That's pretty fucking rad, actually. And the `../..` also works exactly as expected (eg `{{blah ..}}` and `{{blahblah ../..}}`).

#### Reactivity in Meteor

Reactive computation: block of code (inside of a function) that re-runs when a reactive data source _inside_ it changes.


    Template.hello.helpers{(
      counter: function(){
        console.log('counter helper is running')
        return Session.get('count')
      }
    )}


Here, counter re-runs whenever count changes (count is retrieved by Session.get('count_')).  
Session variables are _reactive sources_. Template helpers are _reactive computations_.

Reactive variables in Meteor:

* Session variables
  * defined with `Session.set()`
  * retrieved with `Session.get()`
  * global to the app, and reactive
* Cursors
  * what you get when querying db
  * (via `Collection.find()`)
* Subscription's `ready()` method
  * `subscription.ready()` is when the client has received all data
* some others, including:
  * `Meteor.user()`
  * `Meteor.userId()`
  * `Meteor.status`
  * `Meteor.loggingIn`

Reactive computations:

* template helpers (eg `{{something}}` in a template, duh)
* iron router (third party) hooks are reactive
  * route functions and _most_ hooks are run in a reactive computation

Custom reactivity in meteor:  
reactive-var (third party package) enables defining own reactive variables.  
these don't have global names (like Session.get('foo')'s foo), more like this.foo.get()  
declared like `new ReactiveVar()`.

    var count = new ReactiveVar(0)
    count.set(1)
    count.get() // 1

There's also `ReactiveDict`. That's a thing.

Custom reactive computations:  
`Tracker.autorun(function(){})`  
Read the full Meteor manual for more on that, I guess.

Reactivity can be passed on through composition, eg `var getCount = function(){ return Session.get('count') }` -- getCount is a reactive data source, by virtue of Session.get('count'), which is itself a reactive data source.  
SO...

    Template.hello.helpers({
      counter: function(){
        console.log('counter helper is running')
        return Session.get('count')
      }
    })

IS THE SAME AS

    var getCount = function(){
      return Session.get('count')
    }

    Template.hello.helpers({
      counter: function(){
        console.log('counter helper is running')
        return getCount()
      }
    })

both ways, counter reruns whenever count session variable changes.

composition only applies to functions. not variables.
