about pages

Why do these pages even exist?

  * They provide visitors with the essential facts needed to interact with you/the company
  * Give them the context for the information they'll find on the rest of the site
  * Set yourself/the company apart from others like you/it
  * Give visitors a reason (or as many reasons as possible) to do whatever we're trying to do (call a number, sign up for something, buy something, whatever)

Don't be super generic, bland, grey, and corporate-speaky. People want real, meaningful information, not company statistics.

Don't have a sales-y about page. No one wants to hear that you're a 'world-class' whatever, or that you're committed to such and such a thing where you provide so and so such a best whatever. Just get to the point.

Skip the legal. That's for a 'legal' page.

Design the content of this part of your website the same way you should be designging _every_ part of your site: figure out what your users need, and provide it. Use quotes. Use good photos. Use a 'natural, friendly, confident writing voice' (Erin Kissane, alistapart.com, 2006). Have a personality. But don't make it overwhelming.
