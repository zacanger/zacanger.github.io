Post Number Negative Two!

Note: this is older, but not actually old, just a week or two, pulled from my [Tumblr account](http://zacanger.tumblr.com) for testing purposes.

Okay! Here we go.

### BLOGGY BLOGTIME.

An attempt at this, anyway.  
I NEED A BLOGGING ENGINE.  
Seriously. I mean, static-site compiler. Whatever. There are so many out there, 
but I can't seem to find one that actually works for me. None of them seem
right.  

I'm literally editing text in a javascript bookmarklet that loads the Ace
editor, right now. Which is annoying a little bit, because it's got syntax 
highlighting and errors based on JS, & obviously I'm writing in Markdown, so...
Oh, and I keep automatically returning when before I hit about 80 characters; 
that's kind of dumb. I need to write a new bookmarklet that pulls in Dillinger
or something.  

Hold on, actually....

## WE'RE BACK

This time in ReText. I forgot why I got rid of this writer for two seconds. Of course, then I remembered; it's slow and not great, and also doesn't want to recognize any style sheets, so I'm stick with blinding-bright-mode all the time. That's okay for the moment, though, this'll only take a bit.  

I've been meaning to blog for real for a while, now. I don't mean Tumblr-style miniblogging (reserving 'micro-' for truly miniscule bits like Twitter and YO); actual blogging, like they used to do. Like [Paul Ford](http://ftrain.com), or people who have things to talk about, or... I dunno, experts.

## OKAY WOW

Shit happens and I get into things that last for days. In this case, probably weeks; it's really just a part of a thing that's been going on for years, actually, so whatever. This hasn't exactly been a great first post, has it? I swear I have valuable things to put on paper! Or at least, to type into Nano (yes, Nano. Shut up, VIM people. And don't even start, Emacs cultists, I already have an OS.). Some things coming up on Zac's magical happyfun blogtime extravaganza:

- Installing Debian on an ancient Toshiba Satellite
- Installing Debian on a less ancient Toshiba Portege
- Installing Debian on an HP EliteBook
- Installing Debian on everything
- Installing Debian in a chroot on an Android phone
- Installing other distros, too, on all the devices listed above
- Problems with newfangled filesystems on old hardware
- All the reasons I don't really the design community
- Why Javascript is so ridiculously overrated
- Confusion about otherwise intelligent people using Javascript for things better left to, like, shell scripts. Or C. Lol.
- More things!

So, that'll all be happening. I'mma just pick a blog engine at random here, I guess, because Delposto was close but not really right for me. Even Bashblog, which sounds pretty basic, has too many features and options. Don't want no plugin comment system. Just want a nice looking thingamajig. Mebbe just some Markdown.css and call it a day.  

Oh, I need tagline! Or, whaddaya call it, a signing-off thingy. I used to say this, and it'll do for now:  

Love and tea,
