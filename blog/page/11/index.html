Maybe we should talk.</p><a href="/blog/posts/switch-to-linux-part-two">Read more</a></div></li><li class="post-card"><div><h2><a href="/blog/posts/that-was-fast">That was fast. — 27 September, 2015</a></h2><p>I&#x27;mma go ahead and deploy this now. I&#x27;m doing things the old fashioned way (that is, FTP) because IIS is the worst and it makes me sad. I&#x27;ve decided to stick with bashblog for the moment, only because baker is more than I need. So is bashblog, for that matter, but baker also brings along Bootstrap weight, and that&#x27;s really not something I can see myself needing in blog context. Mostly I write things in Markdown, sometimes peeking in on them with a nifty live preview script to check things; I don&#x27;t need widgets and animations and such, here.</p><a href="/blog/posts/that-was-fast">Read more</a></div></li><li class="post-card"><div><h2><a href="/blog/posts/this-heres-a-test">This Here&#x27;s A Test! — 27 September, 2015</a></h2><p>Well, all right! This is just a little test. I&#x27;ve tried what may well be five or six dozen static site/blog generators over the past few months, and I&#x27;m back at two of the ones I tried first--Bashblog and Baker. They&#x27;re both written in bash, and both pretty simple. I dig bashblog&#x27;s one-file thing, and kind of like the extreme simplicity of the post-editing format, but it&#x27;s a little sloppy and requires some disassembly to actually configure. Baker&#x27;s quite a bit easier to work with, and quite a bit more attractive by default, but it&#x27;s also about three times the size of bashblog. Both of them seem to have Discus/disquszszs/diskust really stuck in there, and I&#x27;m not actually in the mood to sign up for yet another social platform, so... we&#x27;ll have to see about that. OH, and neither one wants to use an alternate implementation of Markdown. not that I mind, there&#x27;s nothing terribly wrong with the original one from John Gruber, but I&#x27;d prefer to at least have that option. There are versions in C and Python that I like (and the C is obviously much faster), as well as the various Javascript implementations that are all the rage these days. It&#x27;d also be nice to work with some extensions. I&#x27;m never sure what&#x27;s kosher in the original because I rarely use it, but I&#x27;m fairly certain I can&#x27;t do tables and syntax hightlighting here.</p><a href="/blog/posts/this-heres-a-test">Read more</a></div></li></ul><div><a style="margin-right:8px" href="/blog/page/10">Newer</a></div></div><footer>Made by <a href="/">Zac Anger</a><br/><br/><a href="/blog/rss.xml">Feed</a> · <a href="/LICENSE.txt">License</a> · <a href="https://github.com/zacanger">GitHub</a> · <a href="https://twitter.com/zacanger">Twitter</a> · <a href="https://mastodon.social/@zacanger">Mastodon</a></footer></body></html>
