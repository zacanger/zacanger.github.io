That&#x27;s just a thing. I really don&#x27;t care all that much
about the browser-side stuff, personally, and I&#x27;m a wee bit sick of a lot of the
client-side frameworks that have most of the market, because they mean you
really have to care about using a lot of JS in the browser... because that&#x27;s
where you&#x27;re doing most of the work.  Things like Angular really show off this
kind of horrible way of building apps. Putting all the work in every person&#x27;s
browser sure makes a lot of sense if you&#x27;ve got one tiny SPA and you&#x27;re serving
it from a home netbook or whatever...  but come on, people. Stop hurting users.
Be realistic. It&#x27;s not even about doing what&#x27;s probably actually the right
thing to do... it can, if you want, just be about the dollar. Users don&#x27;t want
to wait. No one wants to wait. Sending out a whole bunch of scripts to a
three-year-old knockoff tablet from China that&#x27;s running on DSL out in the
country and then figuring that user is okay with waiting while their device
slowly loads it all in and slooowly runs the scripts and then finally starts
showing them the goddamn site they&#x27;re trying to see... that&#x27;s how you lose
people.  There are truckloads of studies out there about the negative impact of
every millisecond, so I won&#x27;t keep rambling, and will start getting down to some
note-taking and summarizing.... Oh, right. I&#x27;m reading through this little
guide, right now, so that&#x27;s what sparked this. I know
I&#x27;ve read it before, but I&#x27;m really hardcore procrastinating learning Redux
right now, so I figured I&#x27;d do something else. This is actually in my school
notes directory, but it may end up as a blog post. Certainly sounds like it. Who
knows?</p><a href="/blog/posts/front-end-performance-notes">Read more</a></div></li><li class="post-card"><div><h2><a href="/blog/posts/you-cant-parse-xhtml-with-regex">you can&#x27;t parse (x)html with regex — 25 December, 2015</a></h2><p>source</p><a href="/blog/posts/you-cant-parse-xhtml-with-regex">Read more</a></div></li><li class="post-card"><div><h2><a href="/blog/posts/xmas-2015">xmas 2015 — 25 December, 2015</a></h2><p>xmas</p><a href="/blog/posts/xmas-2015">Read more</a></div></li><li class="post-card"><div><h2><a href="/blog/posts/erin">erin — 23 December, 2015</a></h2><p>is funny</p><a href="/blog/posts/erin">Read more</a></div></li><li class="post-card"><div><h2><a href="/blog/posts/living-up-to-my-name">living up to my name... — 20 December, 2015</a></h2><p>i don&#x27;t like being angry. at all. it&#x27;s not a good look for me. somehow this weekend turned into one just full of anger about a lot of things. some of them aren&#x27;t a big deal, and i can (eventually) just let everything go, because honestly it&#x27;s just not worth feeling that shitty about. people aren&#x27;t worth it, losing friends isn&#x27;t worth it, losing time and even wasting or losing money... it&#x27;s just never worth being angry about, because it&#x27;s not going to change anything, get me back any time or money, fix relationships, or ever somehow make anything better. this is a little different, though, today. bias against persons with mental illness of any type (especially something as common and relatively safe and understood as depression) is not okay, especially when that results in the wrong people going to fucking jail.</p><a href="/blog/posts/living-up-to-my-name">Read more</a></div></li><li class="post-card"><div><h2><a href="/blog/posts/things-learned-dealing-with-electron-and-the-mean-stack">things learned dealing with electron and the mean stack — 16 December, 2015</a></h2><p>In the interest of blogging the little things, I want to write down a couple of things I learned while struggling through my project. Nothing major, but a few things that I really had to dig to find answers to, buried way underneath unrelated issues in Github and whatnot.</p><a href="/blog/posts/things-learned-dealing-with-electron-and-the-mean-stack">Read more</a></div></li><li class="post-card"><div><h2><a href="/blog/posts/projects-projects-projects">Projects, projects, projects. — 15 December, 2015</a></h2><p>I haven&#x27;t really mentioned what I&#x27;m actually doing here, yet, a whole lot. Well, it should be pretty obvious, but it&#x27;s mostly cramming as much Javascript into my head as I can possibly handle. THen forgetting some, then relearning it. Lots of that, over and over again, until eventually a good bit starts to stick. For a really large list of the stuff I&#x27;ve been working on, I have some public repos on my Github. The pertinent ones would be the actual DevMountain assignments and small projects, and the repo full of extras, things I wanted to learn or messed around with or whatever, since I&#x27;ve been here.</p><a href="/blog/posts/projects-projects-projects">Read more</a></div></li><li class="post-card"><div><h2><a href="/blog/posts/automatic-semicolon-insertion">Automatic Semicolon Insertion — 13 December, 2015</a></h2><p>This is a simplified version of the section from the spec that deals with ASI, because I&#x27;m really tired of all the idiocy and debate about this. It&#x27;s not a big deal whether you use semicolons everywhere or don&#x27;t, but the vitriol from those who use them everywhere really needs to end, and from what I can tell it&#x27;s almost entirely based on this idea that ASI is complicated. ASI is really simple, and its rules are a lot easier to remember than stupidity like ++foo vs foo++, or the rules for this. The actual spec&#x27;s ASI section is less than two pages, but it can be simplified further, into probably less than a page.</p><a href="/blog/posts/automatic-semicolon-insertion">Read more</a></div></li><li class="post-card"><div><h2><a href="/blog/posts/more-on-dreams">more on dreams — 12 December, 2015</a></h2><p>You know, I have the strangest dreams.
