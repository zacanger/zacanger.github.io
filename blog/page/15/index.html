(Good morning/afternoon, incidentally.) My super smart dream interpreter--myself, while in the shower having existential crises and trying to figure everything out--has explained the past several weeks&#x27; worth exactly the same way. I don&#x27;t want to lose people.</p><a href="/blog/posts/more-on-dreams">Read more</a></div></li><li class="post-card"><div><h2><a href="/blog/posts/dreams">dreams — 05 December, 2015</a></h2><p>dreams are weird. usually i don&#x27;t remember them. apparently sometimes i do. because i&#x27;ve been going so damn hard lately, when friday or saturday night comes around, i usually sleep for twelve or more hours straight, and i dream. a lot. very vividly. i&#x27;ve had two super intense dreams lately that, for whatever reason, really had a major effect on me for days later.</p><a href="/blog/posts/dreams">Read more</a></div></li><li class="post-card"><div><h2><a href="/blog/posts/thanksgiving-week-projects-fun-times-and-the-future">Thanksgiving Week, Projects, Fun Times, and The Future — 27 November, 2015</a></h2><p>Jesus fuck it&#x27;s been an interesting week. I&#x27;ve learned so much this week, and managed to get almost nothing done. Markvi is up to version 0.3.0, because it now actually has the keybinds it was always meant to have. The tentatively titled Whiteboard is stuck in planning, because I kind of stopped caring about it, though I really need to get that one done since it&#x27;s the main project that actually matters, here. The other project (the thing that has to do with documentation, and making money) is stalled, but I&#x27;m so ready to get moving on that because it&#x27;s super exciting.</p><a href="/blog/posts/thanksgiving-week-projects-fun-times-and-the-future">Read more</a></div></li><li class="post-card"><div><h2><a href="/blog/posts/quick-little-thing">QUICK LITTLE THING — 21 November, 2015</a></h2><p></p><a href="/blog/posts/quick-little-thing">Read more</a></div></li><li class="post-card"><div><h2><a href="/blog/posts/now-things-get-real">Now things get real. — 19 November, 2015</a></h2><p>Just about done the first week of real, solid, mostly back-end funtimes. Which means, personal projects are about to start. On the one hand, I have ten thousand ideas and twenty thousand technologies I want to try. (Actually, about five Javascript frameworks that I think would be suitable, and three major ideas.) Given the amount of time I&#x27;ve spent on it thus far, I believe I&#x27;ll be running with the &#x27;Tinder for Jobs&#x27; concept. I&#x27;d never even seen the swipe-whatever-way thing until tonight. Now I&#x27;ve downloaded Tinder, swiped left, tapped on things, accidentally swiped right, tried sliding things, was thoroughly disappointed with the super Web 2.0 look and feel, and taken a lot of notes.</p><a href="/blog/posts/now-things-get-real">Read more</a></div></li><li class="post-card"><div><h2><a href="/blog/posts/react-meetup-17-nov-2015">React Meetup, 17 Nov, 2015 — 17 November, 2015</a></h2><p>React:</p><a href="/blog/posts/react-meetup-17-nov-2015">Read more</a></div></li><li class="post-card"><div><h2><a href="/blog/posts/finally-almost-done-with-angular">Finally almost done with Angular... — 11 November, 2015</a></h2><p>Look. I don&#x27;t have anything against Angular on, like, a philosophical level. Or metaphysical. Or personal. I&#x27;m just not impressed. An MVC framework that makes templating easier and makes a lot of other things much more complicated? Client-side rendering? Bogging down browsers doing the heavy lifting so servers can respond a little faster? Very cool features. Very innovative. The year is 2008 and Javascript is starting to come into its own. Open source front-end libraries and frameworks are starting to pop up. Github was just founded. Angular is epic, right?</p><a href="/blog/posts/finally-almost-done-with-angular">Read more</a></div></li><li class="post-card"><div><h2><a href="/blog/posts/no-server-projects">No-Server Projects — 07 November, 2015</a></h2><p>HELLO, and welcome to another episode of Zac&#x27;s Blogtime with the Blogginess!.</p><a href="/blog/posts/no-server-projects">Read more</a></div></li><li class="post-card"><div><h2><a href="/blog/posts/angulaaaaarrrrr">ANGULAAAAARRRRR — 01 November, 2015</a></h2><p>...is fun.
