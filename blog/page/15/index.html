Nothing major, but a few things that I really had to dig to find answers to, buried way underneath unrelated issues in Github and whatnot.</p><a href="/blog/posts/things-learned-dealing-with-electron-and-the-mean-stack">Read more</a></div></li><li class="post-card"><div><h2><a href="/blog/posts/projects-projects-projects">Projects, projects, projects. â€” 15 December, 2015</a></h2><p>I haven&#x27;t really mentioned what I&#x27;m actually doing here, yet, a whole lot. Well, it should be pretty obvious, but it&#x27;s mostly cramming as much Javascript into my head as I can possibly handle. THen forgetting some, then relearning it. Lots of that, over and over again, until eventually a good bit starts to stick. For a really large list of the stuff I&#x27;ve been working on, I have some public repos on my Github. The pertinent ones would be the actual DevMountain assignments and small projects, and the repo full of extras, things I wanted to learn or messed around with or whatever, since I&#x27;ve been here.</p><a href="/blog/posts/projects-projects-projects">Read more</a></div></li><li class="post-card"><div><h2><a href="/blog/posts/automatic-semicolon-insertion">Automatic Semicolon Insertion â€” 13 December, 2015</a></h2><p>This is a simplified version of the section from the spec that deals with ASI, because I&#x27;m really tired of all the idiocy and debate about this. It&#x27;s not a big deal whether you use semicolons everywhere or don&#x27;t, but the vitriol from those who use them everywhere really needs to end, and from what I can tell it&#x27;s almost entirely based on this idea that ASI is complicated. ASI is really simple, and its rules are a lot easier to remember than stupidity like ++foo vs foo++, or the rules for this. The actual spec&#x27;s ASI section is less than two pages, but it can be simplified further, into probably less than a page.</p><a href="/blog/posts/automatic-semicolon-insertion">Read more</a></div></li><li class="post-card"><div><h2><a href="/blog/posts/more-on-dreams">more on dreams â€” 12 December, 2015</a></h2><p>You know, I have the strangest dreams. (Good morning/afternoon, incidentally.) My super smart dream interpreter--myself, while in the shower having existential crises and trying to figure everything out--has explained the past several weeks&#x27; worth exactly the same way. I don&#x27;t want to lose people.</p><a href="/blog/posts/more-on-dreams">Read more</a></div></li><li class="post-card"><div><h2><a href="/blog/posts/dreams">dreams â€” 05 December, 2015</a></h2><p>dreams are weird. usually i don&#x27;t remember them. apparently sometimes i do. because i&#x27;ve been going so damn hard lately, when friday or saturday night comes around, i usually sleep for twelve or more hours straight, and i dream. a lot. very vividly. i&#x27;ve had two super intense dreams lately that, for whatever reason, really had a major effect on me for days later.</p><a href="/blog/posts/dreams">Read more</a></div></li><li class="post-card"><div><h2><a href="/blog/posts/thanksgiving-week-projects-fun-times-and-the-future">Thanksgiving Week, Projects, Fun Times, and The Future â€” 27 November, 2015</a></h2><p>Jesus fuck it&#x27;s been an interesting week. I&#x27;ve learned so much this week, and managed to get almost nothing done. Markvi is up to version 0.3.0, because it now actually has the keybinds it was always meant to have. The tentatively titled Whiteboard is stuck in planning, because I kind of stopped caring about it, though I really need to get that one done since it&#x27;s the main project that actually matters, here. The other project (the thing that has to do with documentation, and making money) is stalled, but I&#x27;m so ready to get moving on that because it&#x27;s super exciting.</p><a href="/blog/posts/thanksgiving-week-projects-fun-times-and-the-future">Read more</a></div></li><li class="post-card"><div><h2><a href="/blog/posts/quick-little-thing">QUICK LITTLE THING â€” 21 November, 2015</a></h2><p></p><a href="/blog/posts/quick-little-thing">Read more</a></div></li></ul><div><a style="margin-right:8px;" href="/blog/page/14">Previous</a><a href="/blog/page/16">Next</a></div></div><footer>Made by <a href="/">Zac Anger</a><br/><br/><a href="/blog/rss.xml">Feed</a> Â·Â <a href="/LICENSE.txt">License</a> Â·Â <a href="https://github.com/zacanger">GitHub</a> Â·Â <a href="https://twitter.com/zacanger">Twitter</a> Â·Â <a href="https://mastodon.social/@zacanger">Mastodon</a></footer></body></html>
