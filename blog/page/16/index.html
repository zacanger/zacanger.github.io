Which, for me, takes a good bit of silence and, like, not needing to think about things other than what I&#x27;m trying to focus on. Kind of problematic, here. Silence and uninterrupted stretches of anything kind of don&#x27;t exist when you&#x27;re living with three other bachelors, and rooming with the youngest (and most talkative) of them.</p><a href="/blog/posts/javascriptssss">Read more</a></div></li><li class="post-card"><div><h2><a href="/blog/posts/im-at-the-end-of-my-patience">i&#x27;m at the end of my patience — 20 October, 2015</a></h2><p>everyone here is here to learn</p><a href="/blog/posts/im-at-the-end-of-my-patience">Read more</a></div></li><li class="post-card"><div><h2><a href="/blog/posts/devmountain-week-2">DevMountain, Week 2 — 19 October, 2015</a></h2><p>That&#x27;s about to start. I&#x27;m tired and I can&#x27;t focus, and I&#x27;m losing a very dear friend to her demons and I can&#x27;t seem to do anything about it no matter how much time I spend on the phone, because at some point I need to turn it off and try to catch up on work. She&#x27;s going to die, and I&#x27;m not going to be there to stop it, and it wouldn&#x27;t matter if I was because nothing would stop her except one specific asshole completely changing everything about himself and being who he must have, at some point, said he was.</p><a href="/blog/posts/devmountain-week-2">Read more</a></div></li><li class="post-card"><div><h2><a href="/blog/posts/javascript">Javascript — 16 October, 2015</a></h2><p>We&#x27;re staring that today, and this is exciting. I never hated CSS until Bootstrap, but now I think I&#x27;d rather debug a hypothetical program written in both PHP and assembler than have to deal with bad CSS ever again.

I&#x27;m in Provo, Utah, doing things that will eventually possibly hopefully make me skilled at something. Maybe even enough to get a job in that thing, and pay off the $$$ needed to get said education. Some quick observations:</p><a href="/blog/posts/i-guess-im-like-in-school-and-stuff-what">Read more</a></div></li><li class="post-card"><div><h2><a href="/blog/posts/not-long-now">not long now... — 08 October, 2015</a></h2><p>I suppose I&#x27;ll be arriving for all that school business soon enough. Maybe, anyway. I believe our bus is about four hours behind schedule at the moment? Three hours? I tell ya what, Greyhound is a freakin&#x27; joke. They&#x27;d&#x27;ve gone out of business long ago, if anyone else was running buses to these parts of the country. Our current driver, though, is just about the nicest I&#x27;ve met. Swell guy. We&#x27;re running a bit behind because of someone who was late arriving from another bus for a transfer... and before that, because of LaWanda (yeah, really) who let us know we were running late and proceeded to take a year and a half to get a move on. And also because some poor dear on this bus got sick. No surprise... this bus (this specific bus, I mean) is filthy, close, claustrophobic... it&#x27;s not pleasant. Our current driver literally started cleaning it as soon as he got out there, while we were at a rest stop; evidently the Greyhound staff, who&#x27;ve needed to boot us out of the bus every six hours or so to service and clean it, were kind of just not doing a single goddamn thing. (This is pretty evident from the state of the restroom--it has neither improved nor even been masked since I switched to this bus in Pittsburgh, and the fellows in the back who&#x27;ve been on it since New York suggest that it&#x27;s been like that since they got on.</p><a href="/blog/posts/not-long-now">Read more</a></div></li><li class="post-card"><div><h2><a href="/blog/posts/im-off">I&#x27;M OFF — 07 October, 2015</a></h2><p>which I guess makes it pretty much official. I&#x27;m going to school. With a duffel bag that weighs about 700 pounds, two laptops, and a kind of shaky knowledge of Javascript (but a lot of interest and passion and a decent background in general computing, with some Bash and a wee bit of Python experience).</p><a href="/blog/posts/im-off">Read more</a></div></li></ul><div><a style="margin-right:8px;" href="/blog/page/15">Previous</a><a href="/blog/page/17">Next</a></div></div><footer>Made by <a href="/">Zac Anger</a><br/><br/><a href="/blog/rss.xml">Feed</a> · <a href="/LICENSE.txt">License</a> · <a href="https://github.com/zacanger">GitHub</a> · <a href="https://twitter.com/zacanger">Twitter</a> · <a href="https://mastodon.social/@zacanger">Mastodon</a></footer></body></html>
