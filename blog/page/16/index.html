Which means, personal projects are about to start. On the one hand, I have ten thousand ideas and twenty thousand technologies I want to try. (Actually, about five Javascript frameworks that I think would be suitable, and three major ideas.) Given the amount of time I&#x27;ve spent on it thus far, I believe I&#x27;ll be running with the &#x27;Tinder for Jobs&#x27; concept. I&#x27;d never even seen the swipe-whatever-way thing until tonight. Now I&#x27;ve downloaded Tinder, swiped left, tapped on things, accidentally swiped right, tried sliding things, was thoroughly disappointed with the super Web 2.0 look and feel, and taken a lot of notes.</p><a href="/blog/posts/now-things-get-real">Read more</a></div></li><li class="post-card"><div><h2><a href="/blog/posts/react-meetup-17-nov-2015">React Meetup, 17 Nov, 2015 — 17 November, 2015</a></h2><p>React:</p><a href="/blog/posts/react-meetup-17-nov-2015">Read more</a></div></li><li class="post-card"><div><h2><a href="/blog/posts/no-server-projects">No-Server Projects — 07 November, 2015</a></h2><p>HELLO, and welcome to another episode of Zac&#x27;s Blogtime with the Blogginess!.</p><a href="/blog/posts/no-server-projects">Read more</a></div></li><li class="post-card"><div><h2><a href="/blog/posts/markvi-1.jpg"> — Invalid date</a></h2><p>�����JFIF��������C�	</p><a href="/blog/posts/markvi-1.jpg">Read more</a></div></li><li class="post-card"><div><h2><a href="/blog/posts/switch-to-linux-part-one">Switch To Linux (Part One) — 27 September, 2015</a></h2><p>So, I enjoyed this post from Steven Ovadia, the fellow who maintains My Linux Rig (which, by the way, is a really great blog, and you should definitely follow it--it&#x27;s kind of like The Setup, but without all the... ah.. fruit.</p><a href="/blog/posts/switch-to-linux-part-one">Read more</a></div></li><li class="post-card"><div><h2><a href="/blog/posts/switch-to-linux-part-two">Switch To Linux!

I&#x27;m 99% sure I&#x27;m totally not ready, not even a little bit. As I keep saying when people ask, I know I know computers well enough, and I know I can pick things up well enough... I&#x27;m just really unfamiliar with Javascript and for some reason it doesn&#x27;t stick well in my head. That&#x27;s probably because I don&#x27;t use it much for fun. It&#x27;s not the language I&#x27;d reach for for most tasks, because (in stark contrast to most of the JS fanpersons on teh Github) I really don&#x27;t believe it should be the default for a lot of things. Javascript has certainly outgrown the cheesy-animations-in-websites days, but why not use a shell script to do things that a shell script would be best for, and C to do things that should probably be done in C, and leave Javascript for doing things best handled in Javascript? Running a big, clunky, really not all that great engine just to handle using a language almost entirely based around working with the web... for doing stuff in the console? It&#x27;s cool and all, yeah. I think it&#x27;s really neat that I could replace most software I use with stuff installed straight from NPM--including the window manager, even. But why would I want to? Cool in theory, I guess, but if I&#x27;m using a tiling window manager the most hipster I&#x27;ll get is Xmonad, and if I need an audio player chances are I&#x27;ll go with (at most) MOC, not a JS clone of Mplayer.</p><a href="/blog/posts/less-than-a-week-til-school">Read more</a></div></li><li class="post-card"><div><h2><a href="/blog/posts/learn-to-code-link-post">Learn To Code; Link Post — 29 September, 2015</a></h2><p>Here we have a giant list of links, sort of unsorted. Much about front-end dev
education, a good bit that I suppose could be devops, quite a bit of tricks and
hackery for the nixes. A good chunk of it is messed up, formatting-wise. Oh
well. THis is basically the leftover links and bits from when I was researching
school options.</p><a href="/blog/posts/learn-to-code-link-post">Read more</a></div></li><li class="post-card"><div><h2><a href="/blog/posts/javascriptssss">JAVASCRIPTSSSS — 25 October, 2015</a></h2><p>Take some concentration. Which, for me, takes a good bit of silence and, like, not needing to think about things other than what I&#x27;m trying to focus on. Kind of problematic, here. Silence and uninterrupted stretches of anything kind of don&#x27;t exist when you&#x27;re living with three other bachelors, and rooming with the youngest (and most talkative) of them.</p><a href="/blog/posts/javascriptssss">Read more</a></div></li><li class="post-card"><div><h2><a href="/blog/posts/javascript">Javascript — 16 October, 2015</a></h2><p>We&#x27;re staring that today, and this is exciting. I never hated CSS until Bootstrap, but now I think I&#x27;d rather debug a hypothetical program written in both PHP and assembler than have to deal with bad CSS ever again. And I don&#x27;t know any assembly languages.</p><a href="/blog/posts/javascript">Read more</a></div></li></ul><div><a href="/blog/page/15">Previous</a><a href="/blog/page/17">Next</a></div></div><footer>Made by <a href="/">Zac Anger</a><br/><br/><a href="/blog/rss.xml">Feed</a> · <a href="/LICENSE.txt">License</a> · <a href="https://github.com/zacanger">GitHub</a> · <a href="https://twitter.com/zacanger">Twitter</a> · <a href="https://mastodon.social/@zacanger">Mastodon</a></footer></body></html>
