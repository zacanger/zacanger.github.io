I&#x27;ve learned so much this week, and managed to get almost nothing done. Markvi is up to version 0.3.0, because it now actually has the keybinds it was always meant to have. The tentatively titled Whiteboard is stuck in planning, because I kind of stopped caring about it, though I really need to get that one done since it&#x27;s the main project that actually matters, here. The other project (the thing that has to do with documentation, and making money) is stalled, but I&#x27;m so ready to get moving on that because it&#x27;s super exciting.</p><a href="/blog/posts/thanksgiving-week-projects-fun-times-and-the-future">Read more</a></div></li><li class="post-card"><div><h2><a href="/blog/posts/quick-little-thing">QUICK LITTLE THING — 21 November, 2015</a></h2><p></p><a href="/blog/posts/quick-little-thing">Read more</a></div></li><li class="post-card"><div><h2><a href="/blog/posts/now-things-get-real">Now things get real. — 19 November, 2015</a></h2><p>Just about done the first week of real, solid, mostly back-end funtimes. Which means, personal projects are about to start. On the one hand, I have ten thousand ideas and twenty thousand technologies I want to try. (Actually, about five Javascript frameworks that I think would be suitable, and three major ideas.) Given the amount of time I&#x27;ve spent on it thus far, I believe I&#x27;ll be running with the &#x27;Tinder for Jobs&#x27; concept. I&#x27;d never even seen the swipe-whatever-way thing until tonight. Now I&#x27;ve downloaded Tinder, swiped left, tapped on things, accidentally swiped right, tried sliding things, was thoroughly disappointed with the super Web 2.0 look and feel, and taken a lot of notes.</p><a href="/blog/posts/now-things-get-real">Read more</a></div></li><li class="post-card"><div><h2><a href="/blog/posts/react-meetup-17-nov-2015">React Meetup, 17 Nov, 2015 — 17 November, 2015</a></h2><p>React:</p><a href="/blog/posts/react-meetup-17-nov-2015">Read more</a></div></li><li class="post-card"><div><h2><a href="/blog/posts/finally-almost-done-with-angular">Finally almost done with Angular... — 11 November, 2015</a></h2><p>Look. I don&#x27;t have anything against Angular on, like, a philosophical level. Or metaphysical. Or personal. I&#x27;m just not impressed. An MVC framework that makes templating easier and makes a lot of other things much more complicated? Client-side rendering? Bogging down browsers doing the heavy lifting so servers can respond a little faster? Very cool features. Very innovative. The year is 2008 and Javascript is starting to come into its own. Open source front-end libraries and frameworks are starting to pop up. Github was just founded. Angular is epic, right?</p><a href="/blog/posts/finally-almost-done-with-angular">Read more</a></div></li><li class="post-card"><div><h2><a href="/blog/posts/no-server-projects">No-Server Projects — 07 November, 2015</a></h2><p>HELLO, and welcome to another episode of Zac&#x27;s Blogtime with the Blogginess!.</p><a href="/blog/posts/no-server-projects">Read more</a></div></li><li class="post-card"><div><h2><a href="/blog/posts/angulaaaaarrrrr">ANGULAAAAARRRRR — 01 November, 2015</a></h2><p>...is fun.

I turn into a whiny annoying bitching asshole. And this time I&#x27;m even more of all of those things because it was one specific person (guess who) who got us sick (us being the rest of the apartment). I mean, look. I&#x27;m not racist, buuutt (yes, here it comes)... this little kid could easily make me racist.</p><a href="/blog/posts/i-am-sick">Read more</a></div></li><li class="post-card"><div><h2><a href="/blog/posts/javascriptssss">JAVASCRIPTSSSS — 25 October, 2015</a></h2><p>Take some concentration. Which, for me, takes a good bit of silence and, like, not needing to think about things other than what I&#x27;m trying to focus on. Kind of problematic, here. Silence and uninterrupted stretches of anything kind of don&#x27;t exist when you&#x27;re living with three other bachelors, and rooming with the youngest (and most talkative) of them.</p><a href="/blog/posts/javascriptssss">Read more</a></div></li><li class="post-card"><div><h2><a href="/blog/posts/im-at-the-end-of-my-patience">i&#x27;m at the end of my patience — 20 October, 2015</a></h2><p>everyone here is here to learn</p><a href="/blog/posts/im-at-the-end-of-my-patience">Read more</a></div></li></ul><div><a style="margin-right:8px;" href="/blog/page/15">Previous</a><a href="/blog/page/17">Next</a></div></div><footer>Made by <a href="/">Zac Anger</a><br/><br/><a href="/blog/rss.xml">Feed</a> · <a href="/LICENSE.txt">License</a> · <a href="https://github.com/zacanger">GitHub</a> · <a href="https://twitter.com/zacanger">Twitter</a> · <a href="https://mastodon.social/@zacanger">Mastodon</a></footer></body></html>
