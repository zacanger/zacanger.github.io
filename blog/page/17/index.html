It&#x27;s very unprofessional to use Internet Explorer, and to interrupt someone at work to criticize something on their website completely unrelated to any client project and ask them to remove it. Also, it&#x27;s not a very nice error page.)</p><a href="/blog/posts/licensing">Read more</a></div></li><li class="post-card"><div><h2><a href="/blog/posts/less-than-a-week-til-school">Less than a week &#x27;til school... — 02 October, 2015</a></h2><p>It&#x27;s pretty crazy. I&#x27;m 99% sure I&#x27;m totally not ready, not even a little bit. As I keep saying when people ask, I know I know computers well enough, and I know I can pick things up well enough... I&#x27;m just really unfamiliar with Javascript and for some reason it doesn&#x27;t stick well in my head. That&#x27;s probably because I don&#x27;t use it much for fun. It&#x27;s not the language I&#x27;d reach for for most tasks, because (in stark contrast to most of the JS fanpersons on teh Github) I really don&#x27;t believe it should be the default for a lot of things. Javascript has certainly outgrown the cheesy-animations-in-websites days, but why not use a shell script to do things that a shell script would be best for, and C to do things that should probably be done in C, and leave Javascript for doing things best handled in Javascript? Running a big, clunky, really not all that great engine just to handle using a language almost entirely based around working with the web... for doing stuff in the console? It&#x27;s cool and all, yeah. I think it&#x27;s really neat that I could replace most software I use with stuff installed straight from NPM--including the window manager, even. But why would I want to? Cool in theory, I guess, but if I&#x27;m using a tiling window manager the most hipster I&#x27;ll get is Xmonad, and if I need an audio player chances are I&#x27;ll go with (at most) MOC, not a JS clone of Mplayer.</p><a href="/blog/posts/less-than-a-week-til-school">Read more</a></div></li><li class="post-card"><div><h2><a href="/blog/posts/paying-for-web-things-what">Paying For Web Things?

Much about front-end dev
education, a good bit that I suppose could be devops, quite a bit of tricks and
hackery for the nixes. A good chunk of it is messed up, formatting-wise. Oh
well. THis is basically the leftover links and bits from when I was researching
school options.</p><a href="/blog/posts/learn-to-code-link-post">Read more</a></div></li><li class="post-card"><div><h2><a href="/blog/posts/switch-to-linux-part-one">Switch To Linux (Part One) — 27 September, 2015</a></h2><p>So, I enjoyed this post from Steven Ovadia, the fellow who maintains My Linux Rig (which, by the way, is a really great blog, and you should definitely follow it--it&#x27;s kind of like The Setup, but without all the... ah.. fruit.</p><a href="/blog/posts/switch-to-linux-part-one">Read more</a></div></li><li class="post-card"><div><h2><a href="/blog/posts/post-number-negative-two">Post Number Negative Two! — 27 September, 2015</a></h2><p>Note: this is older, but not actually old, just a week or two, pulled from my Tumblr account for testing purposes.</p><a href="/blog/posts/post-number-negative-two">Read more</a></div></li><li class="post-card"><div><h2><a href="/blog/posts/notes-and-things-and-stuff">Notes and Things and Stuff — 27 September, 2015</a></h2><p>I&#x27;ll need to edit this script a bit more. Needing to delete all the filler text isn&#x27;t a HUGE deal... if you use a real editor. I mean. It&#x27;s not a huge deal now, but nano&#x27;s not exactly... powerful. I could actually just ^^ start a mark, and then get to where I need to be, and ^k cut it... it&#x27;s the getting aroudn that doesn&#x27;t work so well. Home and end work sort of as expected, but ^Space^ and M-Space to go forward/back one word? No, thank you.</p><a href="/blog/posts/notes-and-things-and-stuff">Read more</a></div></li><li class="post-card"><div><h2><a href="/blog/posts/this-heres-a-test">This Here&#x27;s A Test! — 27 September, 2015</a></h2><p>Well, all right! This is just a little test. I&#x27;ve tried what may well be five or six dozen static site/blog generators over the past few months, and I&#x27;m back at two of the ones I tried first--Bashblog and Baker. They&#x27;re both written in bash, and both pretty simple. I dig bashblog&#x27;s one-file thing, and kind of like the extreme simplicity of the post-editing format, but it&#x27;s a little sloppy and requires some disassembly to actually configure. Baker&#x27;s quite a bit easier to work with, and quite a bit more attractive by default, but it&#x27;s also about three times the size of bashblog. Both of them seem to have Discus/disquszszs/diskust really stuck in there, and I&#x27;m not actually in the mood to sign up for yet another social platform, so... we&#x27;ll have to see about that. OH, and neither one wants to use an alternate implementation of Markdown. not that I mind, there&#x27;s nothing terribly wrong with the original one from John Gruber, but I&#x27;d prefer to at least have that option. There are versions in C and Python that I like (and the C is obviously much faster), as well as the various Javascript implementations that are all the rage these days. It&#x27;d also be nice to work with some extensions. I&#x27;m never sure what&#x27;s kosher in the original because I rarely use it, but I&#x27;m fairly certain I can&#x27;t do tables and syntax hightlighting here.</p><a href="/blog/posts/this-heres-a-test">Read more</a></div></li></ul><div><a style="margin-right:8px;" href="/blog/page/16">Previous</a><a href="/blog/page/18">Next</a></div></div><footer>Made by <a href="/">Zac Anger</a><br/><br/><a href="/blog/rss.xml">Feed</a> · <a href="/LICENSE.txt">License</a> · <a href="https://github.com/zacanger">GitHub</a> · <a href="https://twitter.com/zacanger">Twitter</a> · <a href="https://mastodon.social/@zacanger">Mastodon</a></footer></body></html>
