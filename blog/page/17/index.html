Maybe, anyway. I believe our bus is about four hours behind schedule at the moment? Three hours? I tell ya what, Greyhound is a freakin&#x27; joke. They&#x27;d&#x27;ve gone out of business long ago, if anyone else was running buses to these parts of the country. Our current driver, though, is just about the nicest I&#x27;ve met. Swell guy. We&#x27;re running a bit behind because of someone who was late arriving from another bus for a transfer... and before that, because of LaWanda (yeah, really) who let us know we were running late and proceeded to take a year and a half to get a move on. And also because some poor dear on this bus got sick. No surprise... this bus (this specific bus, I mean) is filthy, close, claustrophobic... it&#x27;s not pleasant. Our current driver literally started cleaning it as soon as he got out there, while we were at a rest stop; evidently the Greyhound staff, who&#x27;ve needed to boot us out of the bus every six hours or so to service and clean it, were kind of just not doing a single goddamn thing. (This is pretty evident from the state of the restroom--it has neither improved nor even been masked since I switched to this bus in Pittsburgh, and the fellows in the back who&#x27;ve been on it since New York suggest that it&#x27;s been like that since they got on.</p><a href="/blog/posts/not-long-now">Read more</a></div></li><li class="post-card"><div><h2><a href="/blog/posts/that-was-fast">That was fast. — 27 September, 2015</a></h2><p>I&#x27;mma go ahead and deploy this now. I&#x27;m doing things the old fashioned way (that is, FTP) because IIS is the worst and it makes me sad. I&#x27;ve decided to stick with bashblog for the moment, only because baker is more than I need. So is bashblog, for that matter, but baker also brings along Bootstrap weight, and that&#x27;s really not something I can see myself needing in blog context. Mostly I write things in Markdown, sometimes peeking in on them with a nifty live preview script to check things; I don&#x27;t need widgets and animations and such, here.</p><a href="/blog/posts/that-was-fast">Read more</a></div></li><li class="post-card"><div><h2><a href="/blog/posts/notes-and-things-and-stuff">Notes and Things and Stuff — 27 September, 2015</a></h2><p>I&#x27;ll need to edit this script a bit more. Needing to delete all the filler text isn&#x27;t a HUGE deal... if you use a real editor. I mean. It&#x27;s not a huge deal now, but nano&#x27;s not exactly... powerful. I could actually just ^^ start a mark, and then get to where I need to be, and ^k cut it... it&#x27;s the getting aroudn that doesn&#x27;t work so well. Home and end work sort of as expected, but ^Space^ and M-Space to go forward/back one word? No, thank you.</p><a href="/blog/posts/notes-and-things-and-stuff">Read more</a></div></li><li class="post-card"><div><h2><a href="/blog/posts/im-off">I&#x27;M OFF — 07 October, 2015</a></h2><p>which I guess makes it pretty much official. I&#x27;m going to school. With a duffel bag that weighs about 700 pounds, two laptops, and a kind of shaky knowledge of Javascript (but a lot of interest and passion and a decent background in general computing, with some Bash and a wee bit of Python experience).</p><a href="/blog/posts/im-off">Read more</a></div></li><li class="post-card"><div><h2><a href="/blog/posts/this-heres-a-test">This Here&#x27;s A Test! — 27 September, 2015</a></h2><p>Well, all right! This is just a little test. I&#x27;ve tried what may well be five or six dozen static site/blog generators over the past few months, and I&#x27;m back at two of the ones I tried first--Bashblog and Baker. They&#x27;re both written in bash, and both pretty simple. I dig bashblog&#x27;s one-file thing, and kind of like the extreme simplicity of the post-editing format, but it&#x27;s a little sloppy and requires some disassembly to actually configure. Baker&#x27;s quite a bit easier to work with, and quite a bit more attractive by default, but it&#x27;s also about three times the size of bashblog. Both of them seem to have Discus/disquszszs/diskust really stuck in there, and I&#x27;m not actually in the mood to sign up for yet another social platform, so... we&#x27;ll have to see about that. OH, and neither one wants to use an alternate implementation of Markdown. not that I mind, there&#x27;s nothing terribly wrong with the original one from John Gruber, but I&#x27;d prefer to at least have that option. There are versions in C and Python that I like (and the C is obviously much faster), as well as the various Javascript implementations that are all the rage these days. It&#x27;d also be nice to work with some extensions. I&#x27;m never sure what&#x27;s kosher in the original because I rarely use it, but I&#x27;m fairly certain I can&#x27;t do tables and syntax hightlighting here.</p><a href="/blog/posts/this-heres-a-test">Read more</a></div></li><li class="post-card"><div><h2><a href="/blog/posts/im-at-the-end-of-my-patience">i&#x27;m at the end of my patience — 20 October, 2015</a></h2><p>everyone here is here to learn</p><a href="/blog/posts/im-at-the-end-of-my-patience">Read more</a></div></li><li class="post-card"><div><h2><a href="/blog/posts/licensing">Licensing — 04 October, 2015</a></h2><p>I just wanted to take a moment to say that I don&#x27;t actually care even the slightest bit if someone is offended by some things that I might say, especially if those things are as basic and trivial as the word &#x27;fuck.&#x27; This was brought up recently, because my error page happens to be &#x27;rude&#x27; and &#x27;unprofessional.&#x27; (Note: I agree. It&#x27;s very unprofessional to use Internet Explorer, and to interrupt someone at work to criticize something on their website completely unrelated to any client project and ask them to remove it. Also, it&#x27;s not a very nice error page.)</p><a href="/blog/posts/licensing">Read more</a></div></li><li class="post-card"><div><h2><a href="/blog/posts/i-cannot-wait">I Cannot Wait — 04 October, 2015</a></h2><p>...to be done with this website, and be done with this &#x27;client.&#x27; It&#x27;s the 4th of October.

I turn into a whiny annoying bitching asshole. And this time I&#x27;m even more of all of those things because it was one specific person (guess who) who got us sick (us being the rest of the apartment). I mean, look. I&#x27;m not racist, buuutt (yes, here it comes)... this little kid could easily make me racist.</p><a href="/blog/posts/i-am-sick">Read more</a></div></li><li class="post-card"><div><h2><a href="/blog/posts/finally-almost-done-with-angular">Finally almost done with Angular... — 11 November, 2015</a></h2><p>Look. I don&#x27;t have anything against Angular on, like, a philosophical level. Or metaphysical. Or personal. I&#x27;m just not impressed. An MVC framework that makes templating easier and makes a lot of other things much more complicated? Client-side rendering? Bogging down browsers doing the heavy lifting so servers can respond a little faster? Very cool features. Very innovative. The year is 2008 and Javascript is starting to come into its own. Open source front-end libraries and frameworks are starting to pop up. Github was just founded. Angular is epic, right?</p><a href="/blog/posts/finally-almost-done-with-angular">Read more</a></div></li></ul><div><a href="/blog/page/16">Previous</a><a href="/blog/page/18">Next</a></div></div><footer>Made by <a href="/">Zac Anger</a><br/><br/><a href="/blog/rss.xml">Feed</a> · <a href="/LICENSE.txt">License</a> · <a href="https://github.com/zacanger">GitHub</a> · <a href="https://twitter.com/zacanger">Twitter</a> · <a href="https://mastodon.social/@zacanger">Mastodon</a></footer></body></html>
