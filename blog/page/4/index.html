NW.js (formerly called &#x27;Node-Webkit&#x27;). Electron&#x27;s really swell, probably offers more options overall, and has a cleaner
way of keeping Node and client-side code separate. NW.js is a heckuva lot easier, overall, though.</p><a href="/blog/posts/getting-up-and-running-with-nwjs-really-super-quickly">Read more</a></div></li><li class="post-card"><div><h2><a href="/blog/posts/bash-builtins">bash builtins — 21 January, 2016</a></h2><p>Let&#x27;s say that in some hypothetical horrible world, we have a system with no utilities, except the shell we&#x27;re using, which happens to be GNU Bash. Maybe we were dumb and did something like rm -rf --no-preserve-root /, I don&#x27;t know. Here&#x27;s how we can get some basic programs back, just by using Bash builtins.</p><a href="/blog/posts/bash-builtins">Read more</a></div></li><li class="post-card"><div><h2><a href="/blog/posts/everything-is-a-stream-or-notes-on-frp">EVERYTHING IS A STREAM, or Notes On FRP — 18 January, 2016</a></h2><p>IT ALL MAKES SENSE NOW.</p><a href="/blog/posts/everything-is-a-stream-or-notes-on-frp">Read more</a></div></li><li class="post-card"><div><h2><a href="/blog/posts/electron-and-nwjs">Electron and NW.js — 15 January, 2016</a></h2><p>Electron (formerly known as Atom Shell) and NW.js (formerly known as Node Webkit) are similar projects that bring Javascript to the desktop. They&#x27;re both based on browser runtimes. Electron is sponsored by Github, and uses libchromiumcontent and Webkit 537 (as of Autumn 2015). NW.js is sponsored by Intel and uses Chromium and Blink/Webkit 537. They both use the V8 JS engine (from Chrome), are fully open source (MIT Licensed), can access a variety of open and licensed codecs, work on Unix-like systems (and, with a little extra work, on Windows), and can use Flash (in Electron&#x27;s case, through the Pepper plugin). The biggest difference I&#x27;ve had in working with them is that Electron, being currently more popular (likely because of the Github support, and the popularity of the Atom editor, which is built on Electron) is usually closer to the current version of Chromium, and NW.js is usually a few versions behind. Electron seems to have a lot more community activity around it right now, too, so there are a lot of useful NPM packages like Electron-Prebuilt (and a lite version) and Electron-Packager (and an interactive version!). Electron also needs a Javascript entry point, which looks something like this:</p><a href="/blog/posts/electron-and-nwjs">Read more</a></div></li><li class="post-card"><div><h2><a href="/blog/posts/differences-from-js">Elm (notes) — 14 January, 2016</a></h2><p>Differences from JS:</p><a href="/blog/posts/differences-from-js">Read more</a></div></li></ul><div><a style="margin-right:8px" href="/blog/page/3">Newer</a><a href="/blog/page/5">Older</a></div></div><footer>Made by <a href="/">Zac Anger</a><br/><br/><a href="/blog/rss.xml">Feed</a> · <a href="/LICENSE.txt">License</a> · <a href="https://github.com/zacanger">GitHub</a> · <a href="https://twitter.com/zacanger">Twitter</a> · <a href="https://mastodon.social/@zacanger">Mastodon</a></footer></body></html>
