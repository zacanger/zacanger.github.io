Express is clearly the most commonly used, but I&#x27;m inclined to jump to Koa whenever I can. The simple fact that the guy who initially started Express passed that off to a company to maintain and instead works on Koa, now (which he also started), says to me that maybe Koa&#x27;s the right way to go.</p><a href="/blog/posts/express-vs-koa-vs-hapi">Read more</a></div></li><li class="post-card"><div><h2><a href="/blog/posts/front-end-performance-notes">Front-End Performance Notes — 28 December, 2015</a></h2><p>Performance matters. That&#x27;s just a thing. I really don&#x27;t care all that much
about the browser-side stuff, personally, and I&#x27;m a wee bit sick of a lot of the
client-side frameworks that have most of the market, because they mean you
really have to care about using a lot of JS in the browser... because that&#x27;s
where you&#x27;re doing most of the work.  Things like Angular really show off this
kind of horrible way of building apps. Putting all the work in every person&#x27;s
browser sure makes a lot of sense if you&#x27;ve got one tiny SPA and you&#x27;re serving
it from a home netbook or whatever...  but come on, people. Stop hurting users.
Be realistic. It&#x27;s not even about doing what&#x27;s probably actually the right
thing to do... it can, if you want, just be about the dollar. Users don&#x27;t want
to wait. No one wants to wait. Sending out a whole bunch of scripts to a
three-year-old knockoff tablet from China that&#x27;s running on DSL out in the
country and then figuring that user is okay with waiting while their device
slowly loads it all in and slooowly runs the scripts and then finally starts
showing them the goddamn site they&#x27;re trying to see... that&#x27;s how you lose
people.  There are truckloads of studies out there about the negative impact of
every millisecond, so I won&#x27;t keep rambling, and will start getting down to some
note-taking and summarizing.... Oh, right. I&#x27;m reading through this little
guide, right now, so that&#x27;s what sparked this. I know
I&#x27;ve read it before, but I&#x27;m really hardcore procrastinating learning Redux
right now, so I figured I&#x27;d do something else. This is actually in my school
notes directory, but it may end up as a blog post. Certainly sounds like it. Who
knows?</p><a href="/blog/posts/front-end-performance-notes">Read more</a></div></li><li class="post-card"><div><h2><a href="/blog/posts/things-learned-dealing-with-electron-and-the-mean-stack">things learned dealing with electron and the mean stack — 16 December, 2015</a></h2><p>In the interest of blogging the little things, I want to write down a couple of things I learned while struggling through my project. Nothing major, but a few things that I really had to dig to find answers to, buried way underneath unrelated issues in Github and whatnot.</p><a href="/blog/posts/things-learned-dealing-with-electron-and-the-mean-stack">Read more</a></div></li><li class="post-card"><div><h2><a href="/blog/posts/automatic-semicolon-insertion">Automatic Semicolon Insertion — 13 December, 2015</a></h2><p>This is a simplified version of the section from the spec that deals with ASI, because I&#x27;m really tired of all the idiocy and debate about this. It&#x27;s not a big deal whether you use semicolons everywhere or don&#x27;t, but the vitriol from those who use them everywhere really needs to end, and from what I can tell it&#x27;s almost entirely based on this idea that ASI is complicated. ASI is really simple, and its rules are a lot easier to remember than stupidity like ++foo vs foo++, or the rules for this. The actual spec&#x27;s ASI section is less than two pages, but it can be simplified further, into probably less than a page.</p><a href="/blog/posts/automatic-semicolon-insertion">Read more</a></div></li><li class="post-card"><div><h2><a href="/blog/posts/code-bootcamps-comparison">Code Bootcamps (Comparison) — 12 October, 2015</a></h2><p>This is old, but I just found it lingering in my important docs directory in Dropbox.
