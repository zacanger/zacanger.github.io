      <p>I have, like, an actual kind of tip, for new-ish developers.</p>
<p>It's pretty simple. Shouldn't be too hard to grasp, maybe a little harder to<br />
implement.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Have confidence in your code.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>If you don't have confidence in your code, then try this:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Write code in which you have confience.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It really sucks to have to walk someone through your code when you're not<br />
sure it's even doing the things it's supposed to do, or when you <em>are</em> sure<br />
it's doing the right things but doing them in a really gross kind of way.</p>
<p>I think this is something everyone struggles with. It's really easy to copy<br />
and paste stuff from StackOverflow, and everyone does it for a while. I still<br />
do it sometimes, though usually with a lot of testing and reading before<br />
actually running that code.</p>
<p>It's really easy, as a new dev, to say "Well, I don't know how to do that thing,<br />
can you just show me?" And that's okay, but it's a lot more okay to say "Hey,<br />
I spent an hour with the docs, here's my implementation, here's the stack trace<br />
and I couldn't find anything helpful on the source's issues or SO, do you have<br />
any ideas?"</p>
<p>It takes a while to write code that you don't hate, but usually even someone<br />
who's been programming for a few months knows what good code looks like. It's<br />
concise, readable, logical, and consistent. It doesn't make you cringe.</p>
<p>I'm not really very good at writing code and feeling great about it. When it<br />
comes to, say, raw Node or a Bash script, I'm usually better with these things<br />
than anyone I know on a personal level, and have no problem taking charge and<br />
just doing things. But when it comes to the things I actually do every day<br />
(which right now means React, Koa, AWS stuff, Docker, trying to read C#, and<br />
Sass, mostly) I know I'm not that great. Knowing that I'm not that great means<br />
I take probably twice as long as I would to get anything done as I would if I<br />
was the best at that thing in the room, because I know people who know more<br />
than I do will be looking at my code and will need to fix it.</p>
<p>That's not a <strong>bad</strong> thing, but it's not a good thing either. It means I'm<br />
programming without confidence, when I'm writing React or Sass. And I'm not<br />
even <em>bad</em> at either, I just have no confidence when writing these things<br />
on a project with people who are better at them than I am. That's something<br />
that I should get over.</p>
<p>Anyway, I meant to write this post on the train and post it when I got home,<br />
but I ended up standing on the train so it's split, from while waiting for the<br />
train 'til 10:30 PM while sitting at DevMountain, so it's probably a little<br />
disjointed.</p>
<p>The point here is, if you have confidence in what you're doing, you'll get<br />
stuff done quicker and better, and if you don't have confidence in what you're<br />
doing, make it so that you can.</p>
