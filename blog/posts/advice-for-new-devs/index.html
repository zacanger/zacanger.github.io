      <p>So, I went to one of those code bootcamps. I started there just over a year ago,<br />
and when I finished the course I worked there as a mentor for a cohort (three<br />
months). Immediately after that, I got what I think is a pretty swell job doing<br />
development full time, working mostly in technologies that I really like.</p>
<p>It's hard to find non-success stories from bootcamps, since generally the people<br />
who go to these things are people who are really determined to do very well. You<br />
don't go and pay $10k-$20k to lock yourself up in a building with a bunch of<br />
other nerds for twelve or moure hours every day for three months straight unless<br />
you really want to get something out of it. I think I'm a good example of<br />
someone who did really well through a bootcamp, though, and the reason I did so<br />
well comes down to really just one thing, which I think everyone going into<br />
computing (whether it's web development, databases, hardware, whatever) really<br />
should be aware of.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>KNOW COMPUTERS</p>
</blockquote>
<p>That seems really obvious, right? But as a mentor it was amazing to me how many<br />
people would come into a course that's just about making things happen with<br />
computers, not knowing a lot of the basics of how to <em>use</em> a computer, and<br />
knowing virtually nothing about how computers actually <em>work</em>. They're not just<br />
a thing with a keyboard and a screen and a logo on the back. They're not just a<br />
status symbol, though Mac users would like you to think they are. They're not<br />
magical, and it's important to know what they do and how they do it, at least in<br />
vague terms.</p>
<p>No junior web dev should really be expected to be familiar with what a page<br />
cache is, or maybe even how domain names are resolved, but you should at least<br />
know what a kernel is, what userland actually means, what the implications of<br />
using your particular filesystem are, what the internet infrastructure kind of<br />
looks like (at least in vague terms), and how to do some basic things that will<br />
save you a lot of time later on (general terminal usage is a good place to<br />
start).</p>
<p>This is the number one thing that can help you get, and stay, ahead as a student<br />
and junior dev, in my opinion. And it's stuff you'll absolutely <em>have</em> to know<br />
at some point, and probably mostly won't be taught, so it's a good idea to just<br />
pick up this stuff as early as possible.</p>
