      <p>this was from some reasonably long time ago</p>
<ul>
<li>Barbara:<ul>
<li>Networking events matter.</li>
<li>Barbara from DM2 ended up as the only actual webdev at her company</li>
<li>This kinda means she's got to be everything from junior dev to PM</li>
<li>Definitely don't be self-deprecating about stuff.</li>
<li>Express interest outright in companies/their products.</li>
<li>Yeah, sure, don't talk yourself <em>up</em> too much, but seriously, communicate
  well about what you've actually managed to do, because they want to know.</li>
<li>Know why it is that a company makes the choices it does. Barbara's
  example: knowing why it was the company she works for uses Angular.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Mark:<ul>
<li>Having past projects to talk about <em>really</em> helps. Obviously. Duh.</li>
<li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Situation,_Task,_Action,_Result">STAR</a> is a thing,
  and maybe I should actually know what that is, I guess?</li>
<li>This is basically a totally disheartening little talk. What?</li>
<li>They asked him to rewrite his whole project in Scala. I'm confused about what
  this guy is actually even talking about. What is this?</li>
<li>His experience is basically one of being put through hell to get in with
  some SAAS analytics-analytics company (yes, that's correct, his company
  analyses analytics).</li>
<li>Actual takeaways: go to meetups, network with people, and talk about <em>why</em>
  you actually want to be doing this.</li>
<li>Trying out actual interviews (like, with companies where it may or may not
  ever happen, but basically you're not really counting on that working out
  anyway) can be a lot more helpful than just going over responses on your own
  or in an absolutely-no-pressure kind of situation.</li>
<li>Oh, wait, okay. As depressing as his little bit was, the actual point of it
  is this: jump through the hoops, because it'll probably be worth it. Maybe
  the company will pay you for your work on the project (I mean, that's kinda
  becoming normal now, anyway). Maybe they won't -- and if they don't, use that
  project or whatever on your portfolio.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Dallin:<ul>
<li>He likes whatever it is that he does now, I guess.</li>
<li>He has 'come to realise more, the many fallacies in his personality.'<ul>
<li>Yay?</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>I don't know that he has any actual advice. Besides, basically, just kinda
  don't be like him, because he's more about learning from mistakes than just,
  like, maybe, not trying to make as many.</li>
<li>He said a lot of other things but I was too busy being really annoyed with
  the damned profiles.devmounta.in project to take any other notes.<ul>
<li>Seriously, it wouldn't kill people to check pull requests before making
    huge commits. I give up.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Dallin learned Ruby in a week between getting hired and actually starting work.
  That's pretty cool. He works mostly in Rails, and I know he does Coffeescript,
  so chances are he learned that on the job (knowing Ruby definitely would've
  helped with that).</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Jeff:<ul>
<li>Don't make portfolio pieces that aren't accessible.<ul>
<li>Example: his Instagram analytics site.</li>
<li>If this isn't possible, do a video demo of that project.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
