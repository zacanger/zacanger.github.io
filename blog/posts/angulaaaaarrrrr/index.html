      <p>...is fun. Also a pain. But fun.</p>
<p>I'm 239% sure I'm falling wayyy behind, but I'm also about 72% sure I started<br />
with a fairly decent headstart--not first in the cohort, for sure, but maybe<br />
around fifth. I think I'll catch up again (hush, I know it's not a race, but I<br />
don't want to be lagging) once we start back-end stuff. Maybe. Angular is nice<br />
and all, but for whatever reason I just can't seem to focus on it for long.<br />
Probably because somewhere deep down in my brain, I just can't bring myself to<br />
love the idea of that much client-side work. It feels like one of those really<br />
awesome things built by people who've never owned really shitty devices, or even<br />
average ones.</p>
<hr />
<p>Things are patched with the roommate. There were words, and things are better.<br />
Still awkward, a bit, I guess, but okay. There's social things afoot,<br />
too--halloween was fun, and there are a few folks here I believe I genuinely<br />
like (shocker, right?). More than one happens to be female, (which is somewhat<br />
amusing given the mostly-single almost-all-male sort of crowd we have here),<br />
but that's not likely to be an issue. Certainly not from their end, and almost<br />
definitely not from mine (I_think_ I know better, by now). Staying focussed<br />
and getting shit done is pretty vital here. So, being an awkward, unfriendly,<br />
unattractive dude has its perks.</p>
<p>Anyhow. It's late. Angular again tomorrow and Tuesday, then an Angular review<br />
day, then two days of Firebase. Not sure how I feel about that last. It'll be<br />
nice to know, I guess, but personally, I'd so much rather start learning<br />
actual backend stuff. Spending two precious days on one single BaaS company<br />
(and a Google-owned one, right after a week and a half of Angular...) seems a<br />
bit much. I do already have an account with them, though, which'll be nice,<br />
and a tiny bit of familiarity--they bought Divshot, with whom I had an<br />
account, so I figured I ought to check them out a little bit.</p>
<p>Bah. Three articles to read, a couple of messy directories to tidy up, and I<br />
suppose I'll put on the coffee for the morning. I think I'll need to ditch<br />
this bash-based blog generator pretty soon--I've already worked up a sort of<br />
Angular generator with Grunt, and another with Yeoman, so maybe soon I can<br />
actually make usable things with Javascript. G'nite.</p>
