<p>I'm 239% sure I'm falling wayyy behind, but I'm also about 72% sure I started with a fairly decent headstart--not first in the cohort, for sure, but maybe around fifth. I think I'll catch up again (hush, I know it's not a race, but I don't want to be lagging) once we start back-end stuff. Maybe. Angular is nice and all, but for whatever reason I just can't seem to focus on it for long. Probably because somewhere deep down in my brain, I just can't bring myself to love the idea of that much client-side work. It feels like one of those really awesome things built by people who've never owned really shitty devices, or even average ones.</p>
<hr>
<p>Things are patched with the roommate. There were words, and things are better. Still awkward, a bit, I guess, but okay. There's social things afoot, too--halloween was fun, and there are a few folks here I believe I genuinely like (shocker, right?). More than one happens to be female, (which is somewhat amusing given the mostly-single almost-all-male sort of crowd we have here), but that's not likely to be an issue. Certainly not from their end, and almost definitely not from mine (I* ****<em>think</em> I know better, by now). Staying focussed and getting shit done is pretty vital here. So, being an awkward, unfriendly, unattractive dude has its perks.</p>
<p>Anyhow. It's late. Angular again tomorrow and Tuesday, then an Angular review day, then two days of Firebase. Not sure how I feel about that last. It'll be nice to know, I guess, but personally, I'd so much rather start learning actual backend stuff. Spending two precious days on one single BaaS company (and a Google-owned one, right after a week and a half of Angular...) seems a bit much. I do already have an account with them, though, which'll be nice, and a tiny bit of familiarity--they bought Divshot, with whom I had an account, so I figured I ought to check them out a little bit.</p>
<p>Bah. Three articles to read, a couple of messy directories to tidy up, and I suppose I'll put on the coffee for the morning. I think I'll need to ditch this bash-based blog generator pretty soon--I've already worked up a sort of Angular generator with Grunt, and another with Yeoman, so maybe soon I can actually make usable things with Javascript. G'nite.</p>
