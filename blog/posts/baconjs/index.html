      <p><em>Note: this post references 'the snake game' a lot. That's over
<a href="here"><a href="https://github.com/zacanger/extras/tree/master/bacon">https://github.com/zacanger/extras/tree/master/bacon</a></a>, now.</em></p>
<p>Bacon is a JS lib for FRP, like Rx, but not MS.</p>
<p>Here's some jQuery, because I don't know why.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>var go = $(&#39;#clickMe&#39;).asEventStream(&#39;click&#39;)
go.onValue (
  () =&gt; $(&#39;#output&#39;).append(&#39;clicked!&#39;))
</pre></div>

<p>Is it just me or is this tutorial using <em>typescript</em>? Eww, it totally is!
Gross.</p>
<p><code>scan</code> combinator is kinda like <code>reduce</code>, except async and produces multiple
values. So, there's an initial value, and a function to combine them. Returned
stream contains the aggregate.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>var clicks = $(&#39;#example button&#39;).asEventStream(&#39;click&#39;)
  , counter = clicks
      .map(1)
      .scan(0, (x,y) =&gt; x + y)
counter.onValue(x =&gt; $(&#39;#example .output&#39;).html(x))
</pre></div>

<p>Ohh, okay, so the 'take' and 'skip' combinators are new. They do what they
sound like. Basically like slicing arrays, but with streams.</p>
<hr />
<p>Since we're avoiding side-effects (yo, this is functional programming), we
instead use <em>event switching</em>. What that means is, <em>when x, do y</em>; for our
case (at least right now?), on event <em>x</em>, start event-stream <em>y</em>. With Bacon,
we'll be mostly using <code>flatMapLatest</code> to handle things here. It takes an event
stream (<em>x</em>), and from each <em>x</em> event, maps it to a new stream (<em>f(x)</em>), for
function <em>f</em>. <code>stream.flatMapLatest(x =&gt; Bacon.sequentially(100, [x, x+1,
x+2]))</code> maps the numeric <em>x</em> events to the stream <code>[x, x+1, x+2]</code>. The delays
here mean that the next even from source <em>x</em> occurs <em><strong>before</strong></em> <code>x+2</code>, so
that's skipped. Only on the last event, after which there are no more <em>x</em>
events, would all source <em>x</em> events appear in the returned stream. So, in
other words, when event <em>x</em> occurs in source steam (<em>x</em>), the output becomes
(or <em>switches!</em>) to <code>f(x)</code> (again, for function <em>f()</em>).</p>
<p>Note (in the snake game) the difference between how we handle the apple and
how we'd handle it imperatively. In 'traditional' (lol) programming, we'd be
updating that from several places in the code, reacting to events. Supposedly
that 'feels more natural' to people? I don't know. I guess I haven't been
programming long enough to feel more natural doing things imperatively.</p>
<p>Event streams are <em>kinda</em> like spreadsheets? Eww, spreadsheets. But it makes
sense, I guess. <code>A1 = B1 + C1</code>; here <code>A1</code> is totally defined in terms of other
'cells' rather than being updated from an external source.</p>
<p>Okay, so implementing our own combinators is pretty nice. We add to Bacon so
we can keep using this little DSL. See the snake game, the bit where we change
window size, for how this is done.</p>
<p>NOTE: <code>snake-game.bak.js</code> is where the actual attempts at learning ended up,
with lots of comments. <code>snake-game.js</code> is the final version, cleaned up and
less ugly and weird and whatever.</p>
