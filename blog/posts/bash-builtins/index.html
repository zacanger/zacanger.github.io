Maybe we were dumb and did something like <code>rm -rf --no-preserve-root /</code>, I don't know. Here's how we can get some basic programs back, just by using Bash builtins.</p>
<p><code>type</code> still exists!</p>
<p>We need an <code>ls</code>. So, <code>echo 'ls() { printf '%s\n' ${1:+${1%/}/}*; }' &gt;&gt; foo.sh</code></p>
<p><code>source foo.sh</code></p>
<p>Here's a rough <code>cat</code>: <code>(while read line; do echo &quot;$line&quot;; done) &lt; stuff.txt</code></p>
<p><code>executable () { if [[ ( ! -d $1 ) &amp;&amp; ( ! -h $1 ) &amp;&amp; -x $1 ]] ; then echo &quot;$1&quot;; fi }</code></p>
<p>To find executables: <code>for file in /*; do executable $file; done</code>.</p>
<p>Wanna just lock ourselves out for real? <code>echo 1 &gt; /proc/sys/kernel/sysrq</code> <code>echo &quot;b&quot; &gt; /proc/sysrq-trigger</code>.</p>
<p>http://eusebeia.dyndns.org/bashcp go here, if we really must rescue a system and have no other options.</p>
