<p>mentoring at a bootcamp is kind of a three-month course on talking/people skills.
most obviously, there's the explaining code you've never seen before to people who have
no idea what you're saying and might not even speak the same language (natively).</p>
<p>working at a bootcamp is like being thrown headfirst into both education and jr dev
roles, which can be overwhelming but also awesome.</p>
<p>hanging out at a bootcamp after finishing is like going back to a high school reunion
after going from nerd to hugely successful nerd, waving it in everyone's face, except
everyone is that same nerd so it's kinda more like an encouraging wave than a &quot;see,
told you i'd amount to something&quot; kind of wave.</p>
