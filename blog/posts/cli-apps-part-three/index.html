      <p>Okay, ready to build another command-line app in Node?</p>
<p>If you haven't seen my last two posts, you should check them out, since I'm not
going to cover a lot of the basics again. They're both on writing small cli apps
in Node, with no dependencies.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://blog.zacanger.com/2016/a-basic-cli-app-in-node.html">React component generator</a></li>
<li><a href="http://blog.zacanger.com/2016/note-taking-app.html">JSON Note-taking app</a></li>
</ul>
<p>And here's the finished product from the latter:</p>
<pre><code class="language-javascript">#!/usr/bin/env node

'use strict'

const { readFileSync , writeFile }  = require('fs')
const log = console.log
const arg = process.argv[2]
const n = './notes.json'
const file = readFileSync(n)
const notes = JSON.parse(file)

const writeTheFile = () =&gt; {
  const taken = JSON.stringify(notes, null, 2)
  writeFile(n, taken, 'utf8', err =&gt; {
    if (err) return log(err)
  })
}

const takeNote = (notes, note) =&gt; {
  notes.push(note)
  writeTheFile()
}

const removeNote = (notes, noteIndex) =&gt; {
  notes.splice(noteIndex -1, 1)
  writeTheFile()
}

const runApp = () =&gt; {
  if (arg) {
    switch (arg) {
      case '-s':
        log(notes)
        break
      case '-r':
        const noteIndex = process.argv[3]
        removeNote(notes, noteIndex)
        break
      default:
        takeNote(notes, arg)
    }
  } else {
    return log('Please pass an argument')
  }
}

if (!module.parent) {
  runApp()
}
</code></pre>
<hr />
<p>What we're going to build this time is going to be a little more complex.
We're going to write a program that downloads a website and turns it into
Markdown for easy offline reading. This isn't a new concept, and I actually
use a Python script called <a href="https://github.com/aaronsw/html2text">html2text</a>
for this on an almost-daily basis, but just for fun, we'll do something
similar in Node.</p>
<p>This will also be the first time we'll be working with external modules, which
is really the most exciting and awesome thing about Node.</p>
<p>Our goal here is to have a small tool we can use like this:</p>
<pre><code class="language-bash">./index.js zacanger.com
</code></pre>
<p>And it'll give us back the contents of <code>zacanger.com</code>, in Markdown, ready to
read in the terminal, pipe to an editor, or whatever.</p>
<p>First things first: we'll need a project. Make a new directory and get into
it, and <code>npm init</code>.</p>
<pre><code class="language-bash">mkdir html2txt
cd html2xt
npm init -y
</code></pre>
<p>The <code>-y</code> flag just means "don't ask me questions." You can skip that flag and
fill in the info for your <code>package.json</code> if you'd like, or just go back and
edit it later.</p>
<p>We're going to be using a couple of things built-in to Node, so we can go
ahead and require them now. We'll need <code>http</code>'s <code>get</code> method, and also a way
to work with an argument. If you've done either of my previous tutorials,
you'll already be familiar with Node's <code>process.argv</code>.</p>
<pre><code class="language-javascript">const { get } = require('http')
const url = process.argv[2]
</code></pre>
<p>Let's see if we can't get some HTML, just as a starting point.</p>
<pre><code class="language-javascript">get(url, res =&gt; {
  res.on('data', d =&gt; {
    console.log(d)
  })
  res.on('end', () =&gt; {
    console.log('done')
  })
})
</code></pre>
<p>Try that out with something like <code>node index.js http://google.com</code>.</p>
<p>You should see something like <code>&lt;Buffer 3c 21 64 6f 63 74 7</code> (and so on).
<a href="https://nodejs.org/api/buffer.html">Buffers</a> are great and all, but that's
pretty useless for actual reading. Try calling <code>toString</code> on that data and you
should see some actual HTML (<code>console.log(d.toString())</code>).</p>
<p>(Note: you may see a 301 page here.)</p>
<p>Awesome! We now have all the functionality of prepending <code>view-source:</code> to a
URL in the browser. Let's do something with that HTML, since it's probably not
how you prefer to read stuff.</p>
<p>There are a lot of great modules out there for working with Markdown. For this
post, I've decided to go with a super simple one without a whole lot of
options, <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/to-markdown">to-markdown</a>. If you're
not super familiar with npm, you're about to learn just about all you need to
know to get started.</p>
<p>In your terminal, <code>npm i -S to-markdown</code>. This is a shorthand for the command
<code>npm install --save to-markdown</code>; most npm commands have shorter versions, and
it can really save you a lot of time if you get used to using them.</p>
<p>You should see a bunch of stuff happen in the terminal. If you check your
<code>package.json</code>, you'll now see <code>to-markdown</code> in there. It should like
something like this:</p>
<pre><code class="language-json">{
  &quot;name&quot;: &quot;something&quot;,
  // probably some other stuff
  &quot;dependencies&quot;: {
    &quot;to-markdown&quot;: &quot;^3.0.1&quot;
  }
}
</code></pre>
<p>Next we'll need to get that into the program. If you're using Babel, you can
use <code>import</code>, but to keep things simple we'll stick with <code>require</code>.</p>
<pre><code class="language-javascript">const toMarkdown = require('to-markdown')
</code></pre>
<p>Now try running the HTML through this before logging it out.</p>
<pre><code class="language-javascript">// ...
const toMarkdown = require('to-markdown')
// ...
  res.on('data', d =&gt; {
    console.log(toMarkdown(d.toString()))
  })
// ...
</code></pre>
<p>If you run the script again, you should see beautiful, super-readable
Markdown! All done!</p>
<hr />
<p>Well, mostly. This is nice and all, but there are definitely some things we
can do to make this script a bit better. Firstly, it's annoying to have to
always type <code>http://</code> before a URL, so maybe we should automatically add that
on.</p>
<pre><code class="language-javascript">const url = process.argv[2]
const src = (url.includes('http://') url.includes('https://')) ? url : `http://${url}`
</code></pre>
<p>All this extra bit is doing is checking if the passed in argument aleady has a
scheme, and if it doesn't, just sticking on on the beginning. If you're not
familiar with template literals, check out the previous tutorials and the
<a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Template_literals">docs on
MDN</a>.</p>
<p>If you're not familiar with <code>Array.prototype.includes()</code>, it's basically a
shorthand for <code>.indexOf(foo !== -1)</code>.</p>
<p>Make sure you change the <code>get</code> call to use <code>src</code> instead of <code>url</code>.</p>
<p>And, as in the previous tutorials, we'll want to just be able to execute this
script, without needing to type in <code>node</code> each time, so add a shebang and make
it exectuable.</p>
<pre><code class="language-shell">chmod +x index.js
</code></pre>
<pre><code class="language-javascript">#!/usr/bin/env node

const { get } = require('http')
// ...
</code></pre>
<p>Now you should be able to just do something like <code>./index.js zacanger.com</code> and
see some results.</p>
<p><code>to-markdown</code> can handle take some options. One of them is to use
<a href="https://help.github.com/categories/writing-on-github">GitHub-Flavored
Markdown</a>, which is
pretty nice since that's probably what most of us are used to using. To enable
this, just pass <code>{ gfm: true }</code> in the call to <code>toMarkdown</code>:</p>
<pre><code class="language-javascript">// ...
console.log(toMarkdown(d.toString(), { gfm: true }))
// ...
</code></pre>
<p>You may notice some tags are making it through the conversion (<code>script</code>,
<code>span</code>, <code>div</code>, and probably a few others); I'm not going to go over all of the
options that <code>to-markdown</code> can take, but you should check out the docs and
learn how to write filters, if you're interested. You could also write your
own function to strip out unwanted elements, and run the Markdown through
this:</p>
<pre><code class="language-javascript">const cleanOutStuff = string =&gt;
  string.replace(/(div|script|span)/g, '')

console.log(cleanOutStuff(toMarkdown(d.toString(), { gfm: true })))
</code></pre>
<p>But it'd probably be easier to just learn the options rather that spinning
something custom like this.</p>
<p>One thing that really irks me when I'm reading in the terminal is text that
doesn't wrap. Sometimes I'm on a very large screen, and it can get difficult
to keep track of where I am when the text is too wide. 80 characters is a
pretty reasonable limit, so why don't we get this text to wrap there? We're
going to use another module for this:
<a href="https://github.com/substack/node-wordwrap">wordwrap</a>.</p>
<pre><code class="language-shell">npm i -S wordwrap
</code></pre>
<pre><code class="language-javascript">const wordwrap = require('wordwrap')
</code></pre>
<p>This module needs to know how many characters it can put in a line. We could
just pass it <code>80</code>, but I think maybe we should handle cases where the terminal
is resized very small but maybe won't stay that way, so we're going to find
out how big the terminal currently is and base our decision on that.
<code>process.stdout</code> has a way for us to find this out.</p>
<pre><code class="language-javascript">const wordwrap = require('wordwrap')
const { rows } = process.stdout
const wraplength = (rows &lt; 80 ? 80 : rows)
const wrapper = wordwrap(wraplength)
</code></pre>
<p>All we're doing here is wrapping to either the width of the terminal or 80
characters, whichever happens to be greater.</p>
<p>Now we can use that <code>wrapper</code> when we log out the results.</p>
<pre><code class="language-javascript">console.log(wrapper(toMarkdown(d.toString(), { gfm: true })))
</code></pre>
<hr />
<p>So, awesome! Your script should now do just about everything you want it to
do. There's really only one big thing left to do: make it less ugly. That
<code>console.log</code> is really getting gross, don't you think? I like to handle this
by just defining a bunch of functions I can throw together, so I don't have to
have all this junk cluttering up my space.</p>
<pre><code class="language-javascript">const opts = { gfm: true }
const convert = a =&gt; toMarkdown(a, opts)
const wrap = a =&gt; wrapper(a)
const log = a =&gt; console.log(a)
</code></pre>
<p>I'm using <code>a</code> as a parameter here. You can use something more descriptive if
you'd like, it really doesn't matter.</p>
<p>And I think we should also just wait until we have all the data before logging
anything, so let's adjust our HTTP call (and stick it in a function):</p>
<pre><code class="language-javascript">const main = arg =&gt; get(arg, res =&gt; {
  let b = '' // `b` for `body`
  res.on('data', d =&gt; b += d.toString)
  res.on('end', () =&gt; log(wrap(convert(b))))
})
</code></pre>
<p>Your linter might yell at you saying you can't return assignment. It's
probably right, but nothing's going to break. If you're concerned about it,
just wrap that <code>b += d.toString()</code> in some braces.</p>
<p>Obviously, this is a function, so we need to call it somewhere.</p>
<pre><code class="language-javascript">main(src)
</code></pre>
<p>We're just passing it our URL that may or may not have <code>http://</code> stuck on to
it.</p>
<hr />
<p>Now you're really done! I suggest you go check out <code>to-markdown</code>, play around
with <code>process</code>, and see what else you can do with this thing. If you make
something pretty neat, you should consider releasing it! Check out <code>npm help
adduser</code> and <code>npm help publish</code> to see how you could go about this. (There are
probably similar modules out there, though, so make sure you're not stepping
on anyone's toes first!)</p>
<p>I'd also suggest you do some basic error handling, but that's totally up to
you.</p>
<p>For the previous two tutorials I waited until the following post to show a
finished version of the script; since this is the last tutorial on writing CLI
apps in Node that I intend to write, the full script is below, as well as my
manifest file (<code>package.json</code>).</p>
<p>Note: I tend to prefer shorter (but hopefully still readable) names for
things, and a somewhat opinionated code style, so the full script below may
differ a bit from your results, and that's totally fine.</p>
