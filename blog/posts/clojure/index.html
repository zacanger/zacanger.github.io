      <p>just a few clojure notes</p>
<p>i don't know if any of this is vastly different from cljs? i'd think not,
because really you're just talking about a different target (jvm vs js vm),
rite? but who knows. i mean, normally you wouldn't talk about clojure and
clojurescript with two different names if they were the exact same language
and the only actual difference was the target vm.</p>
<p>i'd look this up but i'm on a plane. so.</p>
<p>some notes!</p>
<p>everything, i believe, takes the format of <code>(action thingsTo actOn)</code> which is
called a form.</p>
<pre><code class="language-clojure">(def varname varval)
(def me &quot;zac&quot;)
</code></pre>
<p>but there's also the <code>let</code> keyword which is different. for functions?</p>
<pre><code class="language-clojure">(let [myname &quot;zac&quot;]
  (println myname))
</code></pre>
<p>oh wait is it <code>def</code> or <code>defn</code>? crud now i'm seeing <code>defn</code>.</p>
<pre><code class="language-clojure">(defn functionName
  [arguments moreArgs] ;; comment
  returnValue)         ;; the above could be just [] if no args

;; so maybe

(defn multiplier
  [a b]
  (* a b))

(multiplier 4 4)

(defn fnName
  ([ifThisPatternIsMatched] returnThis)
  ([elseIfThisOne sureWhyNot] returnThisInstead))

(defn fooBar
  ([a] a)
  ([a b] (* a b))
  ([a b c] (/ (* a b) c))
  ([a b c d] (* (/ a b) c d)))

;; so [] are args, () are forms, {} are keys or something?
;; no, keys are with :, so {} are just... i don't know, yet.

;; and a private function just has a - after it, i think? like
(defn- thisIsNotPublic
  [] ;; and other stuff -- are in-line comments a thing?
  )
</code></pre>
<p>Testing with lein (what is lein, exactly? I think it's a package manager?):</p>
<pre><code class="language-clojure">(ns project.namespace-test
  (:require [clojure.text :refer :all]
            [project.namespace :refer :all]))

;; deftest defines a test fn
;; testing for description for it
;; is -- assertion

(deftest nameOfTest
  (testing &quot;this is what i'm testing&quot;
    (is (true)))) ;; i don't know if this is valid
</code></pre>
<p>okay so leiningen is 'automation made easy'</p>
<p>pkg mgmt, testing, pm, etc.?</p>
<p><code>lein new app &lt;appname&gt;</code></p>
<p>that will layout a whole project directory for you, damn.</p>
<p>lein searches maven and clojars for packages, with <code>lein search &lt;packagename&gt;</code>.</p>
<p>update <code>:dependencies</code> in <code>project.clj</code> (which i think is like a meta file
package.json-y kinda thing) and do a <code>lein deps</code> to install that stuff.</p>
<ul>
<li><code>lein run</code></li>
<li><code>lein test</code></li>
<li><code>lein repl</code></li>
<li><code>lein install</code></li>
<li><code>lein uberjar</code> -- this packages up the whole rpoject (as a jar, i guess?)</li>
</ul>
<p>zipper is a thing that does things but i don't really have the
attention span to read this right now.</p>
<p>did i mention i was on a plane? i wasn't <em>really</em> on a plane. i'm in an airport.
for a lot of hours. it's a long story. sort of. it's actually a relatively short
story, but it's kind of boring. so whatever.</p>
<p>there are transducers, which are <em>not</em> like a <code>map</code> or <code>functor</code> or whatever.</p>
<p>these are composable transforms</p>
<p>did i mention that i'm in an airport? all night, i'll be here.
meant to be home by now. in bed. sleeping. having seen the people i really miss,
hugs all around, had a beer, unpacked, showered maybe, gone to bed.
i'll be home, instead, by maybe noon-ish tomorrow possibly, having missed
another day of work, sweaty and gross, eurgh.</p>
<p>on the other hand i met some nice people stuck in this zombie airport, so.</p>
