<p>FWIW, I'm now officially at DevMountain (day one, yo), and I think I made the absolute best possible choice here.</p>
<hr>
<h1>bootcamp/immersive education thoughts and notes and stuff</h1>
<h3>version eleventy-million and three, i think. posting here for easy reference.</h3>
<h4>i've ruled out most options, based on the two following sections. i think i've exhausted the research/resource options for this stuff; i can't imagine there's a decent programme in the US that isn't in my browser history by now. it's down to these four.</h4>
<h3>Goals: Looking For</h3>
<ul>
<li>HTML5, CSS required (bonus if they mention modularity of CSS vs CSS2/CSS3 etc)</li>
<li>JS absolutely required (more job listings than all the rest combined, plus obvs. it's the future of the web, and the web is the future of the desktop, etc etc etc)</li>
<li>Multiple <em>modern</em> JS frameworks/libraries a plus (/&amp;/ platforms. though it'd be especially useful to get a handle on angular, iojs, components, ember, and maybe meteor.)</li>
<li>Large focus on <em>design</em> and <em>interaction/experience</em></li>
<li>As in, code bootcamp, but in the context of design, not just random programming for programming's sake (the mrmrs/jxnblk approach, if that's a thing)</li>
<li>Must have job placement assistance.</li>
<li>Less than 10k would be nice, but improbable. Let's say under 15 for tuition, but in a situation/location where housing is feasible.</li>
<li>Minimum of full-time, plus if <em><strong>superhardcore</strong></em> (immersive 60hrs+/week, etc)</li>
<li>Basic server side training is okay, and possibly a plus, but not if emphasized. Really it'd just be nice to understand the 'M' in MEAN.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Goals: To Avoid</h3>
<ul>
<li>ASP/.NET/m$ crap (if it's closed, that means more education needed in 2-5 years when they change the format again)</li>
<li>MacMania (that includes XCode, Swift, Sketch, etc., or any camp with a website that says <em>retina</em> more than twice)</li>
<li>Ruby/on Rails (for SO many reasons. see: rails is a ghetto, RoR performance, the millions of articles/posts re: criticism of ruby both as a language and as a culture. also see: people who are obsessed with ruby. they're almost as oddly cult-like as the apple kids. oh, and ruby's the least in-demand web language, as far as jobs are concerned.)</li>
<li>Places that claim to turn out 'Full Stack Web Designers' (or '...Developers'). It's a nice thought, but there's no such thing as a unicorn (there are maybe a handful of prominent devs who can actually do everything from DBs to IxD, and do it well; but people aren't superhuman. then they'd be superpeople. also, the 'full stack' thing is actually pretty low on the list of recruiter requirements.)</li>
<li>Places that don't proofread (if you can't spellcheck your website, i'm not sure i'd trust you with my education)</li>
<li>PHP (while it's something i do need to know because every company ever apparently still uses giant bloated PHP CMSs, it's something i can pick up on my own, and not something i'd put high up on a CV...)</li>
<li>Any camp that requires membership in other paid services (this includes places that <em>require</em> pre-work through a specific paid vendor and places that require OR only teach with/use a specific proprietary piece of software, eg Photoshop, Sublime Text, etc -- this seems to go along with the mac /&amp;/ ruby fanboyism, though)</li>
</ul>
<h2>The Camps</h2>
<h3>general assembly</h3>
<ul>
<li>EVERYWHERE</li>
<li>12k for web dev, 10 for ux</li>
<li>great reviews from students</li>
<li>also from employers</li>
<li>good job placement</li>
<li>actually has a ux course.</li>
<li><em>looks really good, especially ux course. kinda pricey, but possible DC option could mean no housing costs (though that's not an ideal location, experience-wise). this is the top choice.</em></li>
</ul>
<h3>DevMountain</h3>
<ul>
<li>provo</li>
<li>housing included (which is the primary reason it's actually on this shortlist)</li>
<li>$9k all told</li>
<li>front-end dev + db (incl. react &amp; angular!)</li>
<li>not much info on job assistance</li>
<li>some reviews from students, but not a whole lot out there.</li>
<li><em>looks like a good option financially; not sure about the job placement though. their course looks sound.</em></li>
</ul>
<h3>DevLeague</h3>
<ul>
<li>hawaii</li>
<li>10k</li>
<li>'tads' payment (4k, then 2k for 3 months each)</li>
<li>one needs-based scholarship avail (would likely go towards diversity, though)</li>
<li>simple code challenge (webapp) in application process</li>
<li>good alumni</li>
<li><em>probably best i could actually make it into, but there's no chance i could pay for this one; plane tickets AND housing in honolulu? only on here still because i might win the lottery or something</em></li>
</ul>
<h3>Dev Bootcamp</h3>
<ul>
<li>chicago, nyc, sf</li>
<li>13-14k</li>
<li>9 weeks remote, 9 in person</li>
<li>split into 'phases' with possible free do-overs based on evaluations</li>
<li>there's some coding in the application process, which <em>does</em> include ruby</li>
<li>this place is the original, and their reputation is nearly as good as HR's</li>
<li>program itself seems equally based on actual web tech people skills</li>
<li><em>iffy. very good reputation, but $$$$$. would need a great loan to make this work</em></li>
