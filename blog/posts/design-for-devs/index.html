<p>Would anyone be interested in seeing something like that? This is a short list
of things I might cover:</p>
<ul>
<li>A11Y</li>
<li>Typography</li>
<li>Colour theory</li>
<li>Whitespace</li>
<li>Scalable design (math; see Basscss)</li>

<li>Image manipulation (mostly what <em>not</em> to do)</li>
<li>Importance and longevity of simplicity</li>
<li>KISS</li>
