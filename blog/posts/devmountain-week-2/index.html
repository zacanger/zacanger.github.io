<p>So, that's going on. But on the other hand... Javascript is good. Um.</p>
<hr>
<p>No really, I'm worried as fuck about this friend, and about the other one. Yes, that means I have two friends. Actually, three, but the third is probably the most competent, level-headed, and rational person I know, so I know she can handle herself, and wouldn't want random people worrying about things that are none of their damn business anyway.</p>
<p>I have a roommate. He's amusing. Very chipper, very eager, very Colombian, and very (very, very, very) aroused, all the time, apparently. I don't think he's gone ten minutes without talking about sex so far since I've met him. It's not a horrible thing, but it gets grating. I'm sure there are valid reasons for it (besides youth, that is), and I'm sure it'll cool down after a while.</p>
<p>The first week at school was interesting, for sure. I'm a mile ahead of anyone (as far as I could tell) when it comes to command-line stuff, environment setup, using source control, etc.; in the first ten in the group, probably, with HTML and CSS, though only because I've done these things before (and recently, to boot)... JS, not so much, though I think I'm firmly in the top third, or so. Not wasting time trying to learn the basics of terminal navigation and initialising a git repo gave me a <em>slight</em> headstart. If I can manage to focus and pay attention and not get distracted for once in my life, I can maybe hold on to that.</p>
<p>Okay, anyway. Here's a blog post.</p>
<p>Fuck, I don't know what to do about J. If things end up as poorly as they're threatening, someone will die, and I care about that someone quite a lot. Fuck. I can't get anything done, and other people and human emotions are the reason why.</p>
