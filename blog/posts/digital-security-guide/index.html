<p>Most major tech companies sell your data to advertisers and governments. You
need to stay safe online, so you should be careful about what you use and how
you use it.</p>
<p>All the recommendations here are just that: recommendations. Most users will not
need to follow everything in this guide. Technology changes quickly, so some
recommendations here may be out of date. Use your best judgement and trust what
security experts say (and use your best judgement on which security experts to
trust!).</p>

<h3 id="general">General</h3>
<p>You should try to avoid anything hosted in, or owned by, a company in the US.
You should also use end to end encryption wherever possible. When possible, you
should use open-source software. This is not just an ideological statement; it's
much harder for major security flaws, back doors, and bad practices to make
their way into or survive in software when the source code is frequently read by
hundreds or thousands of people, than in an equivalent piece of software built
and maintained behind closed doors.</p>
<p>Don't use your real name, real address, or information that could be linked to
your identity in sensitive situations. This includes social media, photos, email
addresses, location, and anything else that could be linked to your identity. If
you host a website, use WHOIS privacy protection.</p>
<h3 id="unionizing">Unionizing</h3>
<p>This section is not a guide on unionizing, just security recommendations.</p>
<p>Do not use company Email, Messaging (Slack, Hipchat, etc.), phones, computers,
networks, or other resources for organization. A simple rule of thumb is: If the
company pays for it, don't use it. You have no protection under labor law if you
do. Check your company handbook/policies to see what they can access or claim
they can access, because you may also want to avoid organizing on your own
devices during work hours. Follow the other recommendations in this guide for
what apps and services to use, especially when it comes to messaging and email.</p>
<h3 id="passwords">Passwords</h3>
<p>Prefer random passwords generated by a password manager like
<a href="https://keepassxc.org/">KeePassXC</a>, <a href="https://bitwarden.com/">Bitwarden</a>, or
some other cryptographically secure password generator. Never reuse passwords
anywhere, and rotate your passwords regularly.</p>
<p>If you absolutely must use a password you can remember (such as for your
computer account or disk encryption, prefer long
<a href="https://www.xkcd.com/936/">passphrases</a> over passwords. Check for
password/phrase security <a href="https://howsecureismypassword.net/">here</a>, and check
regularly to see if your data has been involved in a leak
<a href="https://haveibeenpwned.com/">here</a> (<a href="#browsers">Firefox</a> has this feature built
in now). You can also check both your password security and its leak status on
<a href="https://www.experte.com/password-check">this tool</a>.</p>
<h3 id="encryption">Encryption</h3>
<p>Using <a href="https://gnupg.org/">GnuPG</a> (an implementation of PGP) takes some
practice, but is worth it for encrypting files manually and sending encrypted
emails. Check out <a href="https://github.com/bfrg/gpg-guide">this guide</a> to getting up
and running with GPG.</p>
<p>For encrypting directories, use
<a href="https://github.com/rfjakob/gocryptfs">gocryptfs</a>,
<a href="https://cryptomator.org/">Cryptomator</a>, or a similar piece of open source
software. <em>Never</em> use closed-source encryption software</p>
<h3 id="os">OS</h3>
<p>Prefer almost any OS over Windows. Windows is buggy, full of telemetry (read:
Microsoft Spyware), and insecure. If you're tech savvy, learning Linux is a good
route. You could try <a href="https://xubuntu.org/">Xubuntu</a> as a good starter distro.
If you're very tech-minded, you could try <a href="https://www.openbsd.org/">OpenBSD</a> or
<a href="https://www.freebsd.org/">FreeBSD</a>. Mac OS is also a better choice than
Windows, but comes with some of the same vendor lock in (and a huge price tag).</p>
<p>For extreme needs, you should look into <a href="https://tails.boum.org/">Tails</a> or
<a href="https://www.qubes-os.org/">Qubes</a>.</p>
<p>Whichever OS you use, you absolutely need to enable Full-Disk Encryption</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Disk_encryption">Linux</a><ul>
<li>Most Linux distributions will offer setting up FDE at install time, which
  is easier.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><a href="https://forums.freebsd.org/threads/howto-quick-geli-encryption-guide.29652/">BSD</a></li>
<li><a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT204837">Mac</a></li>
<li><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/4028713/windows-10-turn-on-device-encryption">Windows</a></li>
</ul>
<p>For mobile, both iOS and Android are okay options, as long as you keep them up
to date and don't install anything requiring permissions it shouldn't need. In
the Android world, you could also look into Lineage, UBPorts (Ubuntu Phone
fork), and other hobbyist OSs and phones.</p>
<h3 id="browsers">Browsers</h3>
<p>Avoid Chrome. Google's business model is surveillance, and their browser exists
to collect your data. Also avoid Internet Explorer (it's unmaintained and
insecure), Microsoft Edge (because of the telemetry), and anything closed-source
or proprietary (which rules out Opera and Vivaldi).</p>
<p>Do not visit sites over HTTP unless you absolutely have to. Even if the site
doesn't collect your data. Just don't do it. Some browsers have settings to
enforce this, but for the rest, there are extensions such as HTTPS Everywhere.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/">Firefox</a> is all-around the easiest
  option, and has tons of addons.<ul>
<li>Enable HTTPS Only in Preferences.</li>
<li>See <a href="https://github.com/pyllyukko/user.js">here</a> for privacy settings tweaks.</li>
<li>Recommended addons:<ul>
<li><a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/ublock-origin/">uBlock Origin</a>,</li>
<li><a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/privacy-badger17/">Privacy Badger</a>,</li>
<li><a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/duckduckgo-for-firefox/">DuckDuckGo</a>,</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><a href="https://www.waterfox.net/">Waterfox</a> is an independent fork of Firefox.</li>
<li><a href="https://brave.com/">Brave</a> is Chrome-based, has built in ad and tracker
  blocking, and has a Tor mode. It also includes its own advertisements and a
  cryptocurrency, though.</li>
<li><a href="https://www.torproject.org/download/">Tor Browser</a> is a very secure option,
  but will be slow for everyday browsing, and Tor itself has had numerous flaws,
  besides being funded by the US military.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="email">Email</h3>
<p>Avoid Google, Microsoft, Yahoo, and other US companies. Also try to avoid
companies that want your real name. <a href="https://protonmail.com/">Protonmail</a> is in
Switzerland and has a free plan. <a href="https://tutanota.com/">Tutanota</a> also has a
free plan, and is in Germany. See the links at the bottom of the page for more
recommendations.</p>
<h3 id="messaging">Messaging</h3>
<p>You <em>need</em> end-to-end encrpytion for anything sensitive. This means your
communications should be encrypted in transit (TLS 1.2 is the only thing you
should accept as of early 2020), and also encrypted at rest (on the server where
they're stored) without the company running the messaging platform being able to
read them. If communications are not E2EE, you should treat them as if they're
public.</p>
<p>Use <a href="https://signal.org/">Signal</a> for an SMS/KakaoTalk/WhatsApp alternative, and
<a href="https://about.riot.im/">Riot/Matrix</a> for group chat.</p>
<h3 id="mfa">MFA</h3>
<p>Enable <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multi-factor_authentication">MFA</a> wherever
possible. <a href="https://authy.com/">Authy</a> is a convenient MFA app that isn't tied to
a specific device or external (Google, Apple) account. For a hardware device,
check out <a href="https://www.yubico.com/">YubiKey</a>.</p>
<h3 id="search">Search</h3>
<p>Use <a href="https://swisscows.com/">Swisscows</a> or <a href="https://metager.org/">Metager</a> if
possible. <a href="https://duckduckgo.com/">DuckDuckGo</a> and
<a href="https://www.startpage.com/">Startpage</a> are also decent options, but are run by
companies in the US, so are not completely trustworthy. You could also run your
own <a href="https://searx.me/">Searx</a> or <a href="https://yacy.net/">YaCy</a> search engine.</p>
<h3 id="media">Media</h3>
<p>Use <a href="https://youtube-dl.org/">youtube-dl</a> to get videos and music from almost
any website, and <a href="https://www.invidio.us/">Invidious</a> to watch YouTube videosin
the browser. You can play media locally with <a href="https://mpv.io/">MPV</a>.</p>
<h3 id="dns">DNS</h3>
<p>Change your default DNS provider, which is probably your ISP or Google, to
something like <a href="https://blahdns.com/">BlahDNS</a> or
<a href="https://securedns.eu/">SecureDNS</a>. See the links at the bottom of the page for
more recommendations. Avoid DNS providers hosted or run in the US, providers
that have logging, and providers that do not have DNSSEC. You can also use
<a href="https://pi-hole.net/">Pi-hole</a>,
<a href="https://forums.freebsd.org/threads/pi-hole-alternative.67704/">Unbound</a>, or
other systems to block trackers, ads, and other bad IPs. Lists to get you
started are available <a href="https://www.iblocklist.com/">here</a>.</p>
<h3 id="vpn">VPN</h3>
<p>Use a VPN with no logging, that is not hosted or run by a company in the US:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://mullvad.net/en/">Mullvad</a></li>
<li><a href="https://protonvpn.com/">ProtonVPN</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.ivpn.net/">IVPN</a></li>
<li><a href="https://airvpn.org/">AirVPN</a></li>
<li><a href="https://nordvpn.com/">NordVPN</a></li>
</ul>
<h3 id="documents">Documents</h3>
<p>Avoid proprietary and exploitable formats. That means no Microsoft Word
<code>doc</code>/<code>docx</code> and no PDFs if possible. Plain text formats (<code>txt</code>, <code>md</code>, <code>html</code>,
etc.) allow reading through any application and limit the chance of executing
arbitrary code. Use plain text editors that are open source and not made by
major US companies (avoid Google Docs, VS Code, Atom, etc.) as much as you can,
and use LibreOffice when you can't. <a href="#encryption">Encrypt</a> any documents that
contain sensitive data, like information that could be used to identify someone,
schedules, and addresses.</p>
<h3 id="sync">Sync</h3>
<p>Dropbox is a US company, and stores your data on their servers. Prefer a
self-hosted alternative like <a href="https://github.com/haiwen/seafile">Seafile</a>,
<a href="https://github.com/syncthing/syncthing">Syncthing</a>,
<a href="https://github.com/syncany/syncany">Syncany</a>, or
<a href="https://www.sparkleshare.org/">SparkleShare</a>. <a href="#encryption">Encrypt</a> any
sensitive files.</p>
