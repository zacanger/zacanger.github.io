      <p>dreams are weird. usually i don't remember them. apparently sometimes i do.<br />
because i've been going so damn hard lately, when friday or saturday night comes<br />
around, i usually sleep for twelve or more hours straight, and i dream. a lot.<br />
very vividly. i've had two super intense dreams lately that, for whatever<br />
reason, really had a major effect on me for days later.</p>
<hr />
<p>this is the first one, from about two weeks ago. i'm reposting something i<br />
scribbled down on tumblr in the middle of the night, because it's the only thing<br />
i have left of that dream.</p>
<hr />
<p>I just had the most beautiful and but also most terrifying dream I’ve ever had.<br />
I’ll never remember it all but I think I’ve been having it for weeks.</p>
<p>The elephant was first, and he was kind and pure, and I saw humanity grow<br />
through his eyes, and his pity and helplessness. Our senseless cruelty. The<br />
fires. Flying. The toy wasteful, the man murdered in the steam… Something… I’m<br />
forgetting it already. The future, the terrifying majestic post-human<br />
intelligences that looked oddly like turnips…? They rarely moved, and did so by…<br />
Not floating… It was</p>
<p>Oh motherfucker</p>
<p>There was something really important there. The elephant, and the fires, and<br />
the beauty of a new humanity through his eyes, and…</p>
<p>The baby.</p>
<p>Something about growing past the point of suffering.</p>
<p>Fuck. It was really, really important.</p>
<hr />
<p>that makes no sense, i know, but the imagery from that dream is still in my<br />
head, and there was something i realised during it, i don't know what exactly,<br />
but for whatever reason it made things... different.</p>
<p>the second one is a lot clearer. it's the reason i didn't get out of bed until<br />
almost five PM today. i was half awake for several hours, just trying to fix<br />
it, so it didn't end the way it ended. that's ridiculous, fighting with your<br />
own dream to change it, but it was (and still is) really important.</p>
<p>in the second dream, things were somewhat like they are now. more importantly,<br />
the people were the same as they are now, and here. but we had even less time<br />
together. this isn't a dream where i need to go into a lot of detail, because<br />
it's super obvious what it meant, and what i realised about myself from it.</p>
<p>i have grown incredibly fond of some people here, and in a few weeks we're all<br />
going to part ways and probably never see each other again. and i'm so, so<br />
tired of losing people. i've lost a lot of people. i know that's just how<br />
things are, because people grow apart, and have other things to do, and<br />
eventually just aren't around anymore and aren't friends anymore, and that's<br />
just life. but it seems like in the past few years i've lost every person i've<br />
really loved, that way. and now i've found just a couple more who i really,<br />
really appreciate, respect, and enjoy. the kind of good people that i wouldn't<br />
mind knowing for the rest of my life. i'm terrified of losing them, too.</p>
<p>also, i think my dream meant that i need to sleep more during the week, stop<br />
working quite so hard, and maybe just stop caring so much. because we're all<br />
only here to try to get better jobs, not to make emotional connections that<br />
distract from that singular goal. feelings are irrelevant, and i should<br />
probably work on having them just a little less.</p>
