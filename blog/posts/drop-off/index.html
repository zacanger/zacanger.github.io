<p>no body; no mind<br />
no master; no student<br />
no teachings; no knowledge<br />
no me; no you  </p>
<p>only rain over the stream<br />
only hot wind across the sand<br />
only chill through the trees<br />
only snow on the mountain  </p>
<p>if you already know<br />
you don't need to be told<br />
if you don't know<br />
telling you won't do any good  </p>

<h3 id="a-note-on-context-added-later">A note on context, added later</h3>
<p>Written after around four months of especially heavy study and practice. I had
just spent a couple weeks week experimenting with Vajrayana practices with no
luck, and had decided to return to what I knew. The next day (the date on this
post) I decided to read the Shōbōgenzō, to find out more about Chan. I was just
in the first discourse when things blinked. The experience didn't last for even
a second, or maybe it did, but it was timeless. It wasn't flashy or explosive
like the things I experienced when doing kasina practice, but instead felt like
everything shifted. After, I got up and scribbled most of the poem above. Later
that day I rearranged it a bit, and that night I added the last stanza. I
haven't had this experience confirmed by a teacher, but right now it doesn't
feel like I need to; things aren't the same as they were before.</p>
