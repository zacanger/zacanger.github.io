      <p>Electron (formerly known as Atom Shell) and NW.js (formerly known as Node<br />
Webkit) are similar projects that bring Javascript to the desktop. They're both<br />
based on browser runtimes. Electron is sponsored by Github, and uses<br />
libchromiumcontent and Webkit 537 (as of Autumn 2015). NW.js is sponsored by<br />
Intel and uses Chromium and Blink/Webkit 537. They both use the V8 JS engine<br />
(from Chrome), are fully open source (MIT Licensed), can access a variety of<br />
open and licensed codecs, work on Unix-like systems (and, with a little extra<br />
work, on Windows), and can use Flash (in Electron's case, through the Pepper<br />
plugin). The biggest difference I've had in working with them is that Electron,<br />
being currently more popular (likely because of the Github support, and the<br />
popularity of the Atom editor, which is built on Electron) is usually closer to<br />
the current version of Chromium, and NW.js is usually a few versions behind.<br />
Electron seems to have a lot more community activity around it right now, too,<br />
so there are a lot of useful NPM packages like<br />
<a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/electron-prebuilt">Electron-Prebuilt</a> (and <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/electron-prebuilt-lite">a<br />
lite version</a>) and<br />
<a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/electron-packager">Electron-Packager</a> (and <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/electron-packager-interactive">an<br />
interactive<br />
version!</a>).<br />
Electron also needs a Javascript entry point, which looks something like this:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>var app           = require(&#39;app&#39;)
  , BrowserWindow = require(&#39;browser-window&#39;)
require(&#39;crash-reporter&#39;).start()

var mainWindow = null

app.on(&#39;window-all-closed&#39;, function(){
  if(process.platform != &#39;darwin&#39;){
      app.quit()
  }
})
app.on(&#39;ready&#39;, function(){
  mainWindow = new BrowserWindow({
    width                : 1200
  , height               : 800
  , &#39;accept-first-mouse&#39; : true
  , &#39;title-bar-style&#39;    : &#39;hidden&#39;
  , &#39;node-integration&#39;   : false
  })
  mainWindow.loadUrl(&#39;http://127.0.0.1:9090&#39;)
  mainWindow.on(&#39;closed&#39;, function(){
    mainWindow = null
  })
})
</pre></div>

<p>That 'node-integration' line is <em>really important</em> if you want to use certain<br />
client-side libraries like Angular or jQuery that use the word 'module;' your<br />
stuff will just completely break without it.</p>
<p>NW.js, on the other hand, can just be pointed at your <code>index.html</code>, and that's<br />
enough to get started. That's really convenient, but for my own uses I've<br />
found that Electron has a lot more options. Its binaries are significantly<br />
larger, but there are evidently ways to cut them down. Don't count on being<br />
able to build an Electron app in less than a hundred megs, though.</p>
<p>If you're doing something small, like a text editor or some other little<br />
widgety kind of app, you'd probably still be better off with Qt or GTK--you<br />
can write a full text editor in GTK-Webkit with Python in less than 16kb, and<br />
that's if need a full rich-text interface with buttons and such. But for<br />
larger apps, and especially for apps you've already written for the browser,<br />
NW.js and Electron are both really great options. If you're going to be<br />
relying on a lot of the Node environment, Electron's got a better interface to<br />
Node because of its separated rendering and browser engines, but you do have<br />
to keep in mind that you'll be limited as to what client-side libraries you<br />
can use.</p>
