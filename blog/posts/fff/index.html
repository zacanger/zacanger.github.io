      <p>Classes, actually faster than factory functions, by ~twice.
But... who cares, when you're talking about a thousandth of a millisecond?</p>
<p>Better programmers means better software means better solutions for bigger
problems.</p>
<p>Dear Zac: Please start writing tests. Thanks! Love, Zac.</p>
<p>'The Overjustification Effect' ... side projects are valuable in multiple
ways. (I think everyone knew this.)</p>
<p>Clojure: in parens, operator and operands. Example: (doThings toThis andThis
andThis andThis).</p>
<p>APPARENTLY I know 90% of Clojure, now. Cool. Can someone please explain to me
why cljs has brackets and braces, then? Like... wat?</p>
<ul>
<li>Five steps to understanding a new code base:<ul>
<li>Find a mentor who really understands that code base and is willing and able to take the
  time to talk to you about it.</li>
<li>Get an overview of the codebase from said mentor, on style, frameworks, libs, architecture,
  etc. for all of it, then go study all those things <em>apart</em> from the current code so you
  know how they're all supposed to work. Also find out the history of the code.</li>
<li>Complete a task. A tiny feature or bugfix or something.</li>
<li>Don't get stuck. If you're not getting anything done for more than like a half hour or
  whatever and you can't figure it out, <em>ask that mentor</em>.</li>
<li>Code review, review, review code, code, code review.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="functors">FUNCTORS</h3>
<p>I don't really know what a functor is but apparently map and filter are
functors.</p>
<p>Functors are objects that have a map-type method. Not the method itself.</p>
<p>A JS array is a functor. Same with promises (from libraries, not the spec!)
and streams.</p>
