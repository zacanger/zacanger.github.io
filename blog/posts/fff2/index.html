analogy</p>
<p>here's a stream-making thingy</p>
<pre><code class="language-javascript">const foo = {
  each (cb) {
    setTimeout(() =&gt; cb(1), 100)
    setTimeout(() =&gt; cb(2), 200)
    setTimeout(() =&gt; cb(3), 300)
    setTimeout(() =&gt; cb(4), 400)
  }
}
foo.each(console.log)
</code></pre>
<p>prototypes are faster than factory functions but geez they're
kinda gross to think about you know so unless we're doing something
like making ten million objects just use a factory there i guess</p>
<p>streams are functors</p>
<p>functors are just a thing that implements map</p>
<p>monads are functors that also implement <em>flatMap</em></p>
<p>flatMap just flattens, i guess? that's what it sounds like.</p>
<p>so like with Promises for example, <code>.then</code> is like <code>.flatMap</code>.
same with stuff like bind and chain methods and stuff. it's basically
flattening into its <em>value</em> rather than having the actual (semi-expected)
value (function/promise/stream/whatever).</p>
<p>so if you have a flatMap that would return another monad, i guess,
it'd actually return its value, not that other monad.</p>
<p>if you are a tooling addict, don't do tools. (this actually totally applies to
me, because i've spent more time on <a href="https://github.com/zacanger/z.git">my dotfiles</a>
than on any other individual project... <em>but</em> i feel like it's worth it, mostly.
being able to just use vim and not go through the work of setting up any other
editor on any computer, being able to just clone that repo and symlink what i need,
that really does make me more productive. as long as i don't forget how to use
computers without my dotfiles, i don't think they're really a waste of time.)</p>
