      <p>Look. I don't have anything against Angular on, like, a philosophical level. Or<br />
metaphysical. Or personal. I'm just not impressed. An MVC framework that makes<br />
templating easier and makes a lot of other things much more complicated?<br />
Client-side rendering? Bogging down browsers doing the heavy lifting so servers<br />
can respond a little faster? Very cool features. Very innovative. The year is<br />
2008 and Javascript is starting to come into its own. Open source front-end<br />
libraries and frameworks are starting to pop up. Github was just founded.<br />
Angular is epic, right?</p>
<hr />
<p>Come <strong>ON</strong>, people! None of this is impressive. It's almost 2016. Obviously<br />
we need to learn things that are still in use, because that's the shit we'll<br />
be maintaining. But let's not lie. Angular, today, is what Wordpress was three<br />
years ago, and Java three years before that--old, outdated, heavy, and not a<br />
lot of fun. We can stop worshipping the Angular golden calf. We can stop<br />
pretending it's more important to learn Firebase than it is to learn<br />
backends-as-a-service in general. We can stop spending time rewriting<br />
Underscore and get a crash course in Lodash instead. Not that all of that is<br />
useless--it's all valuable knowledge, to be sure--but the <em>attitude</em> about it<br />
isn't incredibly valuable. Technology, and especially web technology, and<br />
<strong>especially</strong> front-end technology, and <em><strong>especially</strong></em> <em>Javascript</em>...<br />
change fast. I'm a Linux user. As much of a Suckless-minded nixer as a Debian<br />
user could possibly be, I expect. I like old. I like stable. But I also like<br />
convenient, fast, simple, small, and better. Is that okay?</p>
<p>Anyway, we're almost done with Angular.<br />
<a href="https://github.com/zacanger/markvi">Markvi</a> still lacks vi functionality, but<br />
I've already been using it regardless--turns out I found the perfect use-case,<br />
too: fixing the readmes for school projects. I may see about adding<br />
synchronized scrolling to help with that... it'd be hella nice. And I still<br />
intend to wrap the whole thing in Electron... just not until after the<br />
no-server project presentations. Turns out getting Angular to work without<br />
being served is a bitch and a half, and getting UI-Router to work at ALL is<br />
just totally pointless. Seriously, ditch that shit and go back to ngRoute.<br />
Save yourself the headache and just go back. UI-Router is buggy, weird,<br />
unstable, and pre-alpha (both in number and in quality). Its internals will be<br />
mostly rewritten before it reaches 1.0. Chances are its API will be the same<br />
(or similar), but why not stick with something that's fully functional  well<br />
supported, has better compatibility, won't be breaking itself, and doesn't eat<br />
errors (seriously, try checking your console when routing seems to fail with<br />
UI-Router... you'll get <strong>nothing</strong>) while waiting for UI-Router to be ready<br />
for actual production use?</p>
<p>This school is really great. I'm learning so much that I quite literally<br />
cannot remember a lot of it. My head is overflowing. A solid half of that is<br />
because of the insane good luck I had in ending up with <a href="http://ryanwalsh.io">my<br />
mentor</a>, probably the most (or at least second-most)<br />
knowledgable and just flat-out <em>good</em> developer here... and ending up with my<br />
housemates, who happen to include not only that mentor but also <a href="http://bryanschauerte.com">another very<br />
capable programmer</a>. Nothing against the school,<br />
though. They're doing a great job, and I think it's worth the money (scratch<br />
that, it's definitely worth the money), but they've recently(?) switched head<br />
instructors, so there's a lot of disconnect right now between lectures and<br />
projects, and more disconnect between projects and what's actually current<br />
and/or correct. I've been trying to help Ryan (the mentor) tidy things up a<br />
little bit, and maybe now that we're starting Node I'll be able to help a bit<br />
more... but either way, the school is trying to work with a student body<br />
that's too diverse, I think (experience-wise, that is--we could certainly use,<br />
like, even a single minority member, and more than three women in the class<br />
wouldn't hurt...). They can't cater to people who come in already knowing<br />
Angular (we have one of those), people who are genuinely interested in<br />
Javascript and are working very hard at it and do all the required work and<br />
then some (that's a good amount of us, myself includied), AND the folks who<br />
copy-and-paste Bootstrap stuff and can't figure out how to navigate their own<br />
code, or people who feel like they can't get anything out of a lecture so they<br />
simply don't come. Everybody paid the same amount to be here (I assume);<br />
everybody's ostensibly here to get a rapid run-down on Javascript and<br />
hopefully come out the other end a full-stack (in terms of Js, anyway)<br />
developer. The website and student handbook and such talked quite a bit about<br />
not waiting for people who fall behind. Why can't we actually do that? I'm not<br />
ahead right now, but I feel like I COULD be if it wasn't for a lot of little<br />
things inhibiting that.</p>
<p>Anyway. Speaking of programming... I ought to go do that. I suppose I should<br />
build a directive and stick an 'about me' page in there or something. I'm<br />
hoping I can take some time today to play with Webpack, Grunt, Browserify,<br />
JSPM, SPM, Gulp, Duo, and Meteor just a tiny bit--trying to figure out some<br />
differences between build systems/task runners/bundlers/project-level package<br />
managers/what-have-yous/whoosey-whatsits... and maybe some thingamabobs as<br />
well.</p>
