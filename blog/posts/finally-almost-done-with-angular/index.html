<p>Come <strong>ON</strong>, people! None of this is impressive. It's almost 2016. Obviously we need to learn things that are still in use, because that's the shit we'll be maintaining. But let's not lie. Angular, today, is what Wordpress was three years ago, and Java three years before that--old, outdated, heavy, and not a lot of fun. We can stop worshipping the Angular golden calf. We can stop pretending it's more important to learn Firebase than it is to learn backends-as-a-service in general. We can stop spending time rewriting Underscore and get a crash course in Lodash instead. Not that all of that is useless--it's all valuable knowledge, to be sure--but the <em>attitude</em> about it isn't incredibly valuable. Technology, and especially web technology, and <strong>especially</strong> front-end technology, and <em><strong>especially</strong></em> <em>Javascript</em>... change fast. I'm a Linux user. As much of a Suckless-minded nixer as a Debian user could possibly be, I expect. I like old. I like stable. But I also like convenient, fast, simple, small, and better. Is that okay?</p>
<p>Anyway, we're almost done with Angular. <a href="https://github.com/zacanger/markvi">Markvi</a> still lacks vi functionality, but I've already been using it regardless--turns out I found the perfect use-case, too: fixing the readmes for school projects. I may see about adding synchronized scrolling to help with that... it'd be hella nice. And I still intend to wrap the whole thing in Electron... just not until after the no-server project presentations. Turns out getting Angular to work without being served is a bitch and a half, and getting UI-Router to work at ALL is just totally pointless. Seriously, ditch that shit and go back to ngRoute. Save yourself the headache and just go back. UI-Router is buggy, weird, unstable, and pre-alpha (both in number and in quality). Its internals will be mostly rewritten before it reaches 1.0. Chances are its API will be the same (or similar), but why not stick with something that's fully functional  well supported, has better compatibility, won't be breaking itself, and doesn't eat errors (seriously, try checking your console when routing seems to fail with UI-Router... you'll get <strong>nothing</strong>) while waiting for UI-Router to be ready for actual production use?</p>
<p>This school is really great. I'm learning so much that I quite literally cannot remember a lot of it. My head is overflowing. A solid half of that is because of the insane good luck I had in ending up with <a href="http://ryanwalsh.io">my mentor</a>, probably the most (or at least second-most) knowledgable and just flat-out <em>good</em> developer here... and ending up with my housemates, who happen to include not only that mentor but also <a href="http://bryanschauerte.com">another very capable programmer</a>. Nothing against the school, though. They're doing a great job, and I think it's worth the money (scratch that, it's definitely worth the money), but they've recently(?) switched head instructors, so there's a lot of disconnect right now between lectures and projects, and more disconnect between projects and what's actually current and/or correct. I've been trying to help Ryan (the mentor) tidy things up a little bit, and maybe now that we're starting Node I'll be able to help a bit more... but either way, the school is trying to work with a student body that's too diverse, I think (experience-wise, that is--we could certainly use, like, even a single minority member, and more than three women in the class wouldn't hurt...). They can't cater to people who come in already knowing Angular (we have one of those), people who are genuinely interested in Javascript and are working very hard at it and do all the required work and then some (that's a good amount of us, myself includied), AND the folks who copy-and-paste Bootstrap stuff and can't figure out how to navigate their own code, or people who feel like they can't get anything out of a lecture so they simply don't come. Everybody paid the same amount to be here (I assume); everybody's ostensibly here to get a rapid run-down on Javascript and hopefully come out the other end a full-stack (in terms of Js, anyway) developer. The website and student handbook and such talked quite a bit about not waiting for people who fall behind. Why can't we actually do that? I'm not ahead right now, but I feel like I COULD be if it wasn't for a lot of little things inhibiting that.</p>
<p>Anyway. Speaking of programming... I ought to go do that. I suppose I should build a directive and stick an 'about me' page in there or something. I'm hoping I can take some time today to play with Webpack, Grunt, Browserify, JSPM, SPM, Gulp, Duo, and Meteor just a tiny bit--trying to figure out some differences between build systems/task runners/bundlers/project-level package managers/what-have-yous/whoosey-whatsits... and maybe some thingamabobs as well.</p>
