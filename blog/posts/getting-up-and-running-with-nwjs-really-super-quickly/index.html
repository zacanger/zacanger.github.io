      <p>There are basically two main ways to build a desktop app in JS: Electron<br />
(formerly called 'Atom-Shell') and NW.js (formerly called 'Node-Webkit').<br />
Electron's really swell, probably offers more options overall, and has a cleaner<br />
way of keeping Node and client-side code separate. NW.js is a heckuva lot<br />
easier, overall, though.</p>
<p>This is what I've been using to build and run Pharaoh:<br />
<a href="https://github.com/nwjs/nw-builder">https://github.com/nwjs/nw-builder</a></p>
<p>There's also a nifty sort of version manager for NW.js here:<br />
<a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/nwjs">https://www.npmjs.com/package/nwjs</a> , which worked a little more smoothly out<br />
of the box, but gave me issues when trying to get Node integration to work.</p>
<p>To get up and running with NW.js using nw-builder, you basically just need to<br />
put the relevant information in your <code>package.json</code>. The relevant info on that<br />
is all here: <a href="https://github.com/nwjs/nw.js/wiki/Manifest-format">https://github.com/nwjs/nw.js/wiki/Manifest-format</a> but mostly<br />
it's just something like</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>&quot;window&quot;: {
  &quot;height&quot;: 800,
  &quot;width&quot;: 1200,
  &quot;title&quot;: &quot;my app&quot;
}
</pre></div>

<p>et cetera. The <code>main</code> field (which usually has, like, <code>server/index.js</code> or<br />
whatever in it), needs to be what NW.js is pointed to. That can be an HTML<br />
file (<code>"main": "./client/public/index.html"</code> or whatever) or a URL (if you're<br />
serving the app, especially locally--this is how Atom, Brackets, LightTable,<br />
etc. do things, except using Electron).</p>
<p>That's basically it, I think. There are a lot of great Yeoman generators and<br />
stuff to scaffold out NW.js apps, but they're mostly overkill.</p>
<p>Using <code>nw-builder</code> makes things pretty simple. <code>npm i -g nw-builder</code>, then<br />
just run <code>nwbuild -h</code> to see the options. (I use <code>nwbuild -r .</code> in the project<br />
root/wherever the relevant <code>package.json</code> is, to run the app).</p>
<p>Their docs are really good, and there's a crapload of options and neat stuff<br />
you can do: <a href="https://github.com/nwjs/nw.js/wiki">https://github.com/nwjs/nw.js/wiki</a></p>
