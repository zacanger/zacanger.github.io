<p>This is what I've been using to build and run Pharaoh: https://github.com/nwjs/nw-builder</p>
<p>There's also a nifty sort of version manager for NW.js here: https://www.npmjs.com/package/nwjs , which worked a little
more smoothly out of the box, but gave me issues when trying to get Node integration to work.</p>
<p>To get up and running with NW.js using nw-builder, you basically just need to put the relevant information in your
<code>package.json</code>. The relevant info on that is all here: https://github.com/nwjs/nw.js/wiki/Manifest-format but mostly
it's just something like</p>
<pre><code class="hljs">&quot;window&quot;: {
  &quot;height&quot;: 800,
  &quot;width&quot;: 1200,
  &quot;title&quot;: &quot;my app&quot;
}
</code></pre>
<p>et cetera. The <code>main</code> field (which usually has, like, <code>server/index.js</code> or whatever in it), needs to be what NW.js
is pointed to. That can be an HTML file (<code>&quot;main&quot;: &quot;./client/public/index.html&quot;</code> or whatever) or a URL (if you're
serving the app, especially locally--this is how Atom, Brackets, LightTable, etc. do things, except using Electron).</p>
<p>That's basically it, I think. There are a lot of great Yeoman generators and stuff to scaffold out NW.js apps, but
they're mostly overkill.</p>
<p>Using <code>nw-builder</code> makes things pretty simple. <code>npm i -g nw-builder</code>, then just run <code>nwbuild -h</code> to see the options.
(I use <code>nwbuild -r .</code> in the project root/wherever the relevant <code>package.json</code> is, to run the app).</p>
<p>Their docs are really good, and there's a crapload of options and neat stuff you can do: https://github.com/nwjs/nw.js/wiki</p>
