      <p>...to be done with this website, and be done with this 'client.' It's the 4th of<br />
October. I'm literally getting on a bus on the 6th and going most of the way<br />
across the country, and will not be spending one tiny bit of effort on this ever<br />
again.</p>
<hr />
<p>Tomorrow, I can hand it over. Along with the invoice. And you know what? I'm<br />
not even worried about the fact that it's an unfinished sort of trainwreck. It<br />
looks nice. All the links work. It's very functional and smooth on all<br />
devices. But at this point I've been sitting here deconstructing PDFs and<br />
fucking docx files to try to get enough content and some even vaguely original<br />
images... that's just ridiculous. I've done my bit. And, what's more, they<br />
haven't done theirs--as laid out in the contract, that is. This client has<br />
been a complete nightmare from the minute they decided their 'sales broker'<br />
needed to have a voice. It'd be nice to see that blowhard's minor heart attack<br />
when he gets this ZIP of files.</p>
<p>To be absolutely clear about this (because I know my attitude here is <em>really</em><br />
unattractive), this was a super simple project. <strong>Bootstrap</strong> simple. Yeah.<br />
Something that could've taken two evenings. It's been about a year now, and<br />
the only things that have changed since the second draught (the first once a<br />
one-pager) are the sticky nav header and the removal of the carousel (to be<br />
replaced 'later' with another one). As far as content goes, I've been able to<br />
get two hasty 'about'  paragraphs out of the folks running this business, a<br />
couple of PDFs (taken from their intranet, actually), a photo of the namesake<br />
(and the same photo again, on three different PDFs with text overlays) and<br />
several copies of the same two logo files. This is a wholesale food business.<br />
Not one bit of info on their food. Not. One.</p>
<p>So... fuck it. I'm done. It's been a year. Thank goodness for simple<br />
time-tracking utilities. I'll make up a slick, presentable invoice, off the<br />
clock.</p>
<p>Oh, if you're curious (don't know why you should be--it's just a bland<br />
Bootstrap site, you've seen a million of them already):<br />
