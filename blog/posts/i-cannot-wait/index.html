      <p>...to be done with this website, and be done with this 'client.' It's the 4th of
October. I'm literally getting on a bus on the 6th and going most of the way
across the country, and will not be spending one tiny bit of effort on this ever
again.</p>
<hr />
<p>Tomorrow, I can hand it over. Along with the invoice. And you know what? I'm
not even worried about the fact that it's an unfinished sort of trainwreck. It
looks nice. All the links work. It's very functional and smooth on all
devices. But at this point I've been sitting here deconstructing PDFs and
fucking docx files to try to get enough content and some even vaguely original
images... that's just ridiculous. I've done my bit. And, what's more, they
haven't done theirs--as laid out in the contract, that is. This client has
been a complete nightmare from the minute they decided their 'sales broker'
needed to have a voice. It'd be nice to see that blowhard's minor heart attack
when he gets this ZIP of files.</p>
<p>To be absolutely clear about this (because I know my attitude here is <em>really</em>
unattractive), this was a super simple project. <strong>Bootstrap</strong> simple. Yeah.
Something that could've taken two evenings. It's been about a year now, and
the only things that have changed since the second draught (the first once a
one-pager) are the sticky nav header and the removal of the carousel (to be
replaced 'later' with another one). As far as content goes, I've been able to
get two hasty 'about'  paragraphs out of the folks running this business, a
couple of PDFs (taken from their intranet, actually), a photo of the namesake
(and the same photo again, on three different PDFs with text overlays) and
several copies of the same two logo files. This is a wholesale food business.
Not one bit of info on their food. Not. One.</p>
<p>So... fuck it. I'm done. It's been a year. Thank goodness for simple
time-tracking utilities. I'll make up a slick, presentable invoice, off the
clock.</p>
<p>Oh, if you're curious (don't know why you should be--it's just a bland
Bootstrap site, you've seen a million of them already):
