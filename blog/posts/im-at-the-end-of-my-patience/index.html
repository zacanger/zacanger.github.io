i don't understand the idea that it's okay to slack off
on doing the basic required work, but take up other people's time
asking questions that, while perfectly valid, are generally answered
either in said required reading, or within the first five results
on google.
i can't keep doing this, because we're now doing things that i actually
really don't know how to do. losing significant amounts of study time
