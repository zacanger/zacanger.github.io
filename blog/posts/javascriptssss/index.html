      <p>Take some concentration. Which, for me, takes a good bit of silence and, like,<br />
not needing to think about things other than what I'm trying to focus on. Kind<br />
of problematic, here. Silence and uninterrupted stretches of anything kind of<br />
don't exist when you're living with three other bachelors, and rooming with the<br />
youngest (and most talkative) of them.</p>
<p>Still... it's been a really crazy couple of weeks, and it's only going to get<br />
crazier. I suppose I'll be trying to move to a private room (and probably<br />
different apartment as well), come the interim... because I'm basically going to<br />
need every tiny bit of the break week(s) just to catch up.</p>
<hr />
<p>This isn't as bad as it sounds, and I'm learning a shitton, but goddamn things<br />
are frustrating sometimes. I'm losing/alienating people I really really ereally<br />
care about because I need to spend every waking minute (and, lately, every<br />
minute is a waking minute) just trying to make up for time lost.</p>
<p>BUUUT tomorrow we start Angular, and I'm super pumped for that, though I'm 99%<br />
certain I don't really know what I'm doing well enough try sticking that paltry<br />
knowledge inside a framework, yet.</p>
<p>Weeee'lll seee....</p>
