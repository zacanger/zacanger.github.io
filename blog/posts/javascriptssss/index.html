<p>Still... it's been a really crazy couple of weeks, and it's only going to get crazier. I suppose I'll be trying to move to a private room (and probably different apartment as well), come the interim... because I'm basically going to need every tiny bit of the break week(s) just to catch up.</p>
<hr>
<p>This isn't as bad as it sounds, and I'm learning a shitton, but goddamn things are frustrating sometimes. I'm losing/alienating people I really really ereally care about because I need to spend every waking minute (and, lately, every minute is a waking minute) just trying to make up for time lost.</p>
<p>BUUUT tomorrow we start Angular, and I'm super pumped for that, though I'm 99% certain I don't really know what I'm doing well enough try sticking that paltry knowledge inside a framework, yet.</p>
<p>Weeee'lll seee....</p>
