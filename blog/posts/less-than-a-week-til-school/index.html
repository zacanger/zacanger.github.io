      <p>It's pretty crazy. I'm 99% sure I'm totally not ready, not even a little bit. As<br />
I keep saying when people ask, I know I know computers well enough, and I know I<br />
can pick things up well enough... I'm just really unfamiliar with Javascript and<br />
for some reason it doesn't stick well in my head. That's probably because I<br />
don't use it much for fun. It's not the language I'd reach for for most tasks,<br />
because (in stark contrast to most of the JS fanpersons on teh Github) I really<br />
don't believe it should be the default for a lot of things. Javascript has<br />
certainly outgrown the cheesy-animations-in-websites days, but why not use a<br />
shell script to do things that a shell script would be best for, and C to do<br />
things that should probably be done in C, and leave Javascript for doing things<br />
best handled in Javascript? Running a big, clunky, really not all that great<br />
engine just to handle using a language almost entirely based around working with<br />
the web... for doing stuff in the console? It's cool and all, yeah. I think it's<br />
really neat that I could replace most software I use with stuff installed<br />
straight from NPM--including the window manager, even. But why would I want to?<br />
Cool in theory, I guess, but if I'm using a tiling window manager the most<br />
hipster I'll get is Xmonad, and if I need an audio player chances are I'll go<br />
with (at most) MOC, not a JS clone of Mplayer.</p>
<hr />
<p>So my point here is that I don't reach for Javascript often, for fun. Even<br />
this blog is build with Bash. I tried alot of static blog engines based on<br />
Javascript (and Coffeescript, and Python, and even C; basically everything<br />
except Ruby, I've probably tried--because TBH the Ruby community provides more<br />
than enough reason to stay away from Ruby). Some of them worked, some of them<br />
very well. All of them had one sort of major problem, though... they overdid<br />
things. Even the 'extremely simple,' 'minimalist,' whatever types, they overdo<br />
things. I neither want nor need 17 types of pages I can render; partials are<br />
great but really, header and fooder are enough; I'm sorry, what EXACTLY is<br />
Mustache doing here, and why can't they spell it with an O?; come on, do we<br />
really need to preprocess CSS when the CSS could fit on two hand-written<br />
pages, and is the same for every page?; etc., etc., etc. And that seems to be<br />
the trademark of the do-everything-in-Javascript types: make <strong>everything</strong><br />
happen in JS, and default to using 'frameworks' (ahem, a tiny bit of<br />
templating code !== a framework) rather than writing simpler things, even if<br />
it means using twice the code and doing things half as quick.</p>
<p>Ergh. Anyway, I'm sick, and in quite a lot of pain. There's a website (note<br />
the use of the suffix <em>site</em> here) that finally has some (sort of) content, so<br />
I'll be finishing that up today. And then, my mentor (with whom I had a video<br />
chat yesterday--nice fellow, seems very knowledgable and friendly) recommended<br />
working on a personal project in Javascript before arriving at<br />
<a href="http://devmounta.in">DevMountain</a>, to really reinforce the concepts--and<br />
given all of the above, I think that's probably exactly what I need. So...<br />
maybe I'll work up a blog compiler that, y'know, is actually as simple as most<br />
of them advertise. Markdown (does <strong>any</strong> implementation of Markdown default<br />
to a line break with a newline, or do they all need two spaces?) +<br />
header/footer partials, to HTML; automatically updated index/archive pages;<br />
CSS doing its own thing quietly in the corner... and, I think, not a single<br />
'<script>' anywhere in the site.</p>
