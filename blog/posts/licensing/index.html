<p>Look, I really don't care. <em>Fuck</em> isn't a particularly nasty word. It's not a slur, it's not demeaning, it's not a word used specifically to marginalize or hurt any individual people or groups thereof. So fuck you.</p>
<p>This relates to licenses only in that I usually opt for the <a href="http://wtfpl.net">WTFPL</a> over other free licenses. Maybe it's kind of offensive to some, but there's actually a valid reason for that. Following is the full text of the license.</p>

<p>And here's a paragraph from the <a href="http://www.wtfpl.net/faq/">FAQ</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>But profanity is offensive!</strong></p>
<p>You know what? Fuck your stance on profanity. Fuck your priorities in life.
The WTFPL is about fucking freedom and we mean it. Freedom means freedom to
copy and modify and share works of art and science with the rest of mankind,
but also freedom to be gay and marry and have crazy gay sex, freedom to have
tattoos, freedom to say there is no God, freedom to take the pill, freedom
to have an abortion. People die for being gay or atheists. Don’t tell me that
there is something sacred enough that it must be protected from the mere
existence of the word “fuck”. If the F in WTFPL offends you, then fuck you
and your beliefs.
Triple fuck you.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So... that's pretty clear now, yes?</p>
