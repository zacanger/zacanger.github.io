      <p>I just wanted to take a moment to say that I don't actually care even the<br />
slightest bit if someone is offended by some things that I might say, especially<br />
if those things are as basic and trivial as the word 'fuck.' This was brought up<br />
recently, because my <a href="http://zacanger.com/whateverrandomblablahblah">error page</a><br />
happens to be 'rude' and 'unprofessional.' (<em>Note: I agree. It's very<br />
unprofessional to use Internet Explorer, and to interrupt someone at work to<br />
criticize something on their website completely unrelated to any client project<br />
and ask them to remove it. Also, it's not a very nice error page.</em>)</p>
<hr />
<p>Look, I really don't care. <em>Fuck</em> isn't a particularly nasty word. It's not a<br />
slur, it's not demeaning, it's not a word used specifically to marginalize or<br />
hurt any individual people or groups thereof. So fuck you.</p>
<p>This relates to licenses only in that I usually opt for the<br />
<a href="http://wtfpl.net">WTFPL</a> over other free licenses. Maybe it's kind of<br />
offensive to some, but there's actually a valid reason for that. Following is<br />
the full text of the license.</p>

<p>And here's a paragraph from the <a href="http://www.wtfpl.net/faq/">FAQ</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>But profanity is offensive!</strong></p>
<p>You know what? Fuck your stance on profanity. Fuck your priorities in life.<br />
The WTFPL is about fucking freedom and we mean it. Freedom means freedom to<br />
copy and modify and share works of art and science with the rest of mankind,<br />
but also freedom to be gay and marry and have crazy gay sex, freedom to have<br />
tattoos, freedom to say there is no God, freedom to take the pill, freedom<br />
to have an abortion. People die for being gay or atheists. Don’t tell me that<br />
there is something sacred enough that it must be protected from the mere<br />
existence of the word “fuck”. If the F in WTFPL offends you, then fuck you<br />
and your beliefs.<br />
Triple fuck you.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So... that's pretty clear now, yes?</p>
