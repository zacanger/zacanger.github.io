<p>Things continue to be interesting. Drawing an orange line in the air, seeing a
deity in bubbles of light, supporting a glowing blue being with my cupped hands,
my hands themselves flickering in and out of existence, drawing a dharmachakra
on a door in blue sparkly fire, bright purple malleable clouds, overwhelming
feelings of bliss — the longer I sit, as long as I'm patient and don't restart
the cycle, the stranger and more intense things get. I'm moving more towards
only light as an object, since good candles aren't cheap, and it also gets a
usable after-image much faster.</p>
<p>I have trouble sometimes not slipping into noting everything, which I didn't
realize was a habit I'd built until I started these couple weeks of kasina-based
practice with the intention of reaching at least the fourth samatha jhana (as
defined in the Vimuttimagga and clarified in MCTB). When I do switch back to
insight practice (in about a week), I hope some of this translates into
something valuable.</p>
<h2 id="2021-01-01">2021-01-01</h2>
<p>I had trouble getting warm this morning, so I tried tummo practice for a while.
Psychologically, at least, it worked, but that could be because I was so focused
on the visualization and breath control that I forgot about being cold. My body
temperature went up about 1.5 degrees (F), but that's not a significant amount.</p>
<p>I read <em>The Slacker's Guide To Stream-Entry</em> today, a short log from someone I
assume is a Catholic that goes into some parallels between Christian mysticism
and Buddhism. I was hoping for an actual guide to stream-entry, but it was
interesting anyway. One big thing I got out of it was the idea of breaking one
meditation up into a few periods of 15-30 minutes with 5-10 minute breaks to
stretch and do walking meditation. That may help a bit with discomfort,
especially since my legs tend to fall asleep during longer sits (I haven't found
a posture that completely helps — Burmese style seems to be good for my legs,
but not for my back; half-lotus and cross-legged with a zafu seem to be good for
my back, but my legs fall asleep).</p>
<p>Fire/light kasina practice (after reading the Vimuttimagga I've started thinking
of kasina practice using my pinhole flashlight contraption as light kasina, not
fire) hasn't really progressed much, just the same cycles. I can't seem to stay
in the murk for more than 10 minutes or so without getting bored or distracted
and starting a fresh cycle, though I can stretch it out longer when it's
completely dark and I can see shapes and colors in the murk more clearly, so
nighttime practice has been going better than during the day. I can still play
with it, move colors around, change colors (very slowly), etc., but that gets
old pretty fast. I haven't experienced anything that sounds like fourth jhana
yet, and am starting to wonder if I should switch things up by trying a
different kasina, dropping the mantra I try to keep running all the time, or
some other change. Or maybe I just need need to put in more time; my practice
probably totals less than four hours a day right now, so I could try going for
six or eight over the next few days and seeing how things go.</p>
<h2 id="2020-12-31">2020-12-31</h2>
<p>Still doing fire and light kasina practice. I haven't made any significant
progress the past few days, just more of the same cycles, though they're getting
faster and I'm able to "see" things more clearly. I'm sitting more and more
(yesterday was around two and a half hours, across a few sits), hoping the extra
time will help me get tired of bliss and visuals and move on to the fourth
jhana. We'll see. I'm planning on giving this another week and then switching
back to insight practices.</p>
<h2 id="2020-12-28">2020-12-28</h2>
<p>A good artificial light source is better than a low quality (dim, flickering,
diffused) flame, but a good quality candle flame seems to be nicer than an
artificial light. That could be some internal bias I have against using an LED
light or whatever else since it feels "unnatural", though.</p>
<p>The visual aspects of second jhana through a kasina can be fun, but I want to
move ahead. It doesn't help that I keep getting drawn into having fun with them.
I've touched on third jhana, but haven't been able to stay there consistently or
to push on to fourth. Seeing through one's eyelids and being able to physically
squish the swirling visual field with one's hands doesn't actually have any
practical value, I think.</p>
<h2 id="2020-12-27">2020-12-27</h2>
<p>I've noticed that the initial nimitta tends to take on recognizable shapes
sometimes, especially when I start with something brighter than a candle. I
fashioned a little "nimitta-getting" device out of a flashlight, some cardboard,
and tape, to get a pinhole light with a yellowish surrounding, and that's
working much better than candles have been. I'm not sure what's up with the
candles — it could be the altitude, or some air currents I'm not feeling, or
maybe I should've just spent the money on beeswax. This thing is working fine,
though. The shapes seem to come up right around when the very first white/purple
spot starts to fade to red, before it rounds out into a dot. I've seen
completely random things like the shapes of Texas and Australia, and a padlock
side-by-side with a five-pointed star. I assume this is just the brain trying to
find meaning in a confusing, relatively new, experience, so I just notice it,
pay attention, and wait for it to solidify and round down to a small circle.</p>
<p>I've also noticed (for months now, I just wasn't writing about it back then)
that when my attention wanders, I can see/feel it. It's like walking a dog that
keeps trying to dart off, and I can feel the tug on the leash and see the
direction it's going in, except the leash is made of elastic, and the elastic
got stronger/tighter over time.</p>
<h2 id="2020-12-26">2020-12-26</h2>
<p>I read the <a href="https://firekasina.org/">fire kasina book</a> over the last couple
days, and some things make more sense now. I'm back to reading the Vimuttimagga
which might clarify more. I was interested to read that Shannon Stein's fear
stage also included little crab-like things. I don't know if that's common but
it seems awfully specific. Maybe we just both dislike shellfish.</p>
<p>My practice has been interesting. I found out that, if I have trouble getting a
dot to start with when I think I should have one, blinking twice helps me find
it, like when someone takes a photo with a flash and you blink a few times and
see spots (the exact same thing, probably).</p>
<p>I'm also able to rise to what I believe is third jhana within about 20 minutes
(three or four cycles), but haven't figured out how to turn over into fourth
yet. I'm fairly confident about saying it's third jhana now, since that lines up
with what's in MCTB and the fire kasina book, as well as what I've read
elsewhere. There's a distinct dropping-off of the sort of feeling of awe and
joy, attention spreads to the whole visual/inner-visual field, a dopamine rush
that comes and then falls away, and if I briefly (less than one out-breath)
attend to pain anywhere (like my lower back, which is killing me as I'm typing
this) it vanishes (the pain, not my back). And I can just sit without wanting to
return to second. I think the trick will be to sit for long enough that I get
tired of it, but not so tired of it that I get up.</p>
<p>Another fun thing is that I can play with the stuff in the visual field.
Eventually, more single-pointed things come back in, not necessarily red or
white dots but just concentrated areas of cloud stuff. I can move those around,
or, using my hands, I can kind of shape and form the whole thing. I tried
pressing the lighter parts together into a fairly thin vertical line, then
squishing that down into a ball I could hold, then flicking it out to take up
the whole field again. I can't draw in colors, but it's neat to be able to play
with the stuff that's already there.</p>
<p>One more interesting note is that the initial nimitta tends to flicker more now,
and I've gone from perceiving it as spinning to flickering. Maybe it was
flickering all along, and it was just too fast for me to see. The flickering
aspect of basically everything is still growing, making me wonder what that will
do when I switch back to insight practices.</p>

<h3 id="notes-about-siddhispowers">Notes About Siddhis/Powers</h3>
<p>Condensed and edited version of the instructions in
<a href="https://www.mctb.org/mctb2/table-of-contents/part-vi-my-spiritual-quest/65-how-to-cultivate-the-powers/">MCTB2</a>
(see the <a href="https://www.mctb.org/about/">fair use notice</a>). I have not attained
the powers (I have not attained fourth jhana yet), I just wanted to have this in
a place where I could easily reference it. I may edit this more as I progress.</p>
<p>First, be able to attain at least fourth jhana with a variety of objects.
Kasina meditation is a good way to go here, particularly using fire (a candle).
You can tell which jhana you're in by the qualities. First jhana: rapture,
pleasure, still with discriminating thought, takes effort; second: rapture,
pleasure, tranquility, effortless; third: sense of non-attachment, bodily
pleasure; fourth: no particular pleasure and no particular pain, clarity, pure
mindfulness and equanimity.</p>
<p>Quietly and mindfully make yourself and your meditation area clean: take a calm
shower, put on clean clothes, tidy up. Make any other preparations that make
sense in context, like prayers, etc.</p>
<p>Think the whole thing through. Your intentions, your reactions, and as many
possible outcomes as you can think of. Think about what you're planing to
request or intend, how to phrase it specifically, why you want this (and reason
out if there's a root issue that really needs your attention instead of what
you were thinking of), everyone and/or everything involved, and every possible
outcome or ramification for everyone and/or everything involved (negative or
positive, as much as possible; try visualizing your magic echoing out along
space and time as far as you can).</p>
<p>If the previous step, especially the last part, doesn't feel completely okay
with you, you should stop now and rethink it. This is a time when deeply
thinking about karma is useful.</p>
<p>Rise through the jhanas to at least fourth, but up through past eighth if you
can. Do it slowly, carefully, and deeply so you're in a strong and steady
state. It helps to have been working on concentration practice specifically in
the days or weeks leading up to this. (From the descriptions I'm not sure if
it's even possible without retreat time).</p>
<p>When you are as high in the jhanas as you can get, leave that state, and
formally intend to make happen whatever you want to happen (as you decided on
earlier), releasing all of the energy of your intent out into the world without
any restraint or hesitation. You have to be absolutely committed. Let it out,
then let it go.</p>
<h2 id="2020-12-24-2">2020-12-24-2</h2>
<p>I just practiced for about an hour: fifteen minutes on a candle, maybe five
minutes walking and with a streetlight, and I reclined and used my phone's
flashlight for two cycles. The candle cycles weren't particularly interesting,
except that I feel like (from the descriptions) I briefly touched on third
jhana.</p>
<p>The first phone flashlight cycle was pretty standard: retina burn after-image,
red dot, black disk, counter-clockwise spinning thing (like a circle with
spikes, or maybe a 9-pointed star, murk). The second cycle was not standard.</p>
<p>The second time I hit my eyeballs with that light, it started off pretty normal,
like above. Then I hung out in the murk and just tried to see all of it. The
greenish white cloudy stuff, purplish black stuff, little sparkles. One of the
sparkles seemed fairly stationary, and it's the holidays, so I willed for there
to be more of them and for them to fall like snow, which didn't exactly work,
but more of them did come into focus and move downwards (as long as I was
keeping my focus on them). Around this time I was feeling pretty good,
physically. Aches, pains, itches, all either vanished or turned into nice
sensations.</p>
<p>Then the flickering started. It was like giant white glowing books with their
pages being flipped, or a deck of cards being shuffled, maybe. Huge and white,
coming from both sides, on top of light black. Then the sort of white pulsing
circles that I usually see showed up, but they also started flickering, and had
some spikes or something around the outside. Somewhere in here I also clearly
saw a woman dancing and spinning in a circle, but when she turned to face me her
face turned into a creepy demonic type thing, stuck out its tongue, and then
she/it vanished.</p>
<p>Anyway, back to the circle: like I said, lots of flickering recently, but this
white flickering circle with spikes was new. It expanded until it sort of zoomed
up and fit around my head, and suddenly it hit me that it's not just the circle
or things in my visual field that are flickering, I'm the one flickering, or I'm
included in the flickering. When I say "it hit me" I mean I felt it like cold
water hit my chest and mind at the same time, it had a physical impact.</p>
<p>I'm not sure how that fits into the maps since, as far as I know, I shouldn't be
expecting any big insights or even strong visualizations at this point, but it
was a jarring enough experience that I wanted to write it up tonight so I didn't
forget anything, rather than wait until tomorrow morning. It felt weirdly
bad-good, like if someone suddenly grabs your shoulder and you're a little
shocked and freaked out, but then you turn around and see that it's someone you
love and trust, so there's a mixture of relief and happiness — except all of
those emotions happened in maybe one or two seconds.</p>
<h2 id="2020-12-24">2020-12-24</h2>
<p>Still working on fire kasina practice. Not much luck last night. I was able to
get black discs regularly, but they faded quickly, and I wasn't getting a red
dot. At first I thought it was because of the candles; I was using one that
had a pretty dim flame, then tried switching to a different one, but due to
where it was in burning down, I couldn't see that one clearly over the top or
through the jar it's in. Then I thought that was nonsense and it was clearly
due to my concentration and I shouldn't blame external factors, but after
getting up to switch back to the previous candle, I tried using a streetlight,
and was able to get a very clear red dot after less than 10 seconds and hold
it with my eyes open, so now I think it really was the candles. I ended up
going back to bed and using my phone's flashlight for a few more very clear
cycles (after-image, red dot, red dot spinning counter-clockwise with a bit of
yellow in the middle, fading darker, growing little points around the outside,
black disk, murk). That all took a good hour or so and it was getting late, so
even though I'd figured out the problem I didn't keep at it. Tonight should be
better.</p>
<p>Key takeaway: the quality of the light definitely matters, at least for
getting a clear nimitta to work with. If you try this and use a candle, it's
important for it to be bright, steady, and clearly visible (not diffused and
distorted through the thick lip of a mason jar, for example).</p>
<p>A side note: I bought myself a zafu for Christmas, rather than sitting on the
floor or my bed mat, and having my hips raised like this is definitely
helping with pain and keeping a good posture. Highly recommended.</p>
<p>Another side note: my visual perception of reality doesn't seem to be all
that stable since I started this. I forget what night it was, but I was
typing something up and saw my left hand and left side of my computer
keyboard shift maybe six inches to the left and then back again, as quick as
you could blink. And there's a low-frame-rate sort of thing going on when my
eyes are closed, including while practicing. This seems related to
understanding impermanence eventually, so I'm not concerned about it, it's
just curious.</p>
<h2 id="2020-12-23">2020-12-23</h2>
<p>Nothing much happened last night except for cycles, over and over again:
flame, dot, red dot, murk, sometimes a black dot. At one point I tried
willing the black dot to change color, saying "be green, be green" in my
head, which didn't exactly work, but it got a sort of green hazy aura around
it, so that's something. I also was able to sustain the nimitta with my eyes
open and get it back quickly from other sources like a street lamp and car
headlights.</p>
<h2 id="2020-12-22">2020-12-22</h2>
<p>Last night I had a false start trying to get into fire kasina meditation, got
up for a bit, then settled down into it. I was able hold onto the nimitta for
longer each cycle, but got into the murk and had trouble expanding attention.
I kept at it anyway for a bit, then went to bed holding onto the mantra I'd
been using in the background (I've been attracted to the Heart Sutra mantra
recently, so it was that one), and kept my attention also on the vague
purple/green/white swirls of the murk.</p>
<p>While watching the murk a bunch of strange visuals came up. I don't know how
suggestible this stuff is, but it definitely sounded like bhaya-nana (fear)
from some of the descriptions I've read. I distinctly remember some sort of
warrior-like figures out of a fantasy movie, specifically helmets/masks and
armor that reminded me of the witch-king of Angmar's costume in the LOTR
films. Also an odd effect that was like a thin sliver of a flashlight (like if
you hold your hand over the light and part your fingers a bit) passing over
some faces, one that was a full-face mask, one that was rotting, one that had
blood running across it. Also some visuals of bugs, some crabs or crab-like
things, and other generally kind of creepy stuff. The weird thing was, I can't
really stand bugs, but none of that freaked me out, maybe because I was still
holding on to the mantra and just watching this stuff pop up and then
disappear into the murk. Eventually I did fall asleep.</p>
<p>I'm not sure how this is related, but about 30 or 40 minutes after I went to
sleep, I had a huge shock of energy through my core and bolted upright.
I was shaking, but it felt like everything else (reality) was shaking. At
first I thought there was an earthquake, and I shot off a quick prayer to
Avaloketisvara that it wasn't "The Big One", but then I looked at my water
bottle, and it wasn't shaking, then got up and looked at other objects, and
they weren't shaking. I wasn't shaking either, my hands and limbs seemed
steady, so it was just my perception of everything. I don't know where that
came from but it was intense and disconcerting. I went back to bed holding
onto a simpler mantra (om mani padme hum).</p>
<p>Something else that's probably worth mentioning is that when I use a mantra
as the only object or primary object (but not when I'm using it to augment
something else, so far), it sort of expands on itself, especially if I set
into it somewhat melodically instead of just reciting it. For example with
"Om Mani Padme Hum", if I keep it at one note, eventually a slight harmony
will be added a fourth above, and then that one tries to creep up to a flat
fifth and then a fifth. If I start the Heart Sutra mantra, eventually it
takes on a melody of its own that I didn't consciously indent for it, and
then that seems to double and triple like multiple voices singing in unison.
Possibly related, the soft nimitta (whether it's the "murk" from kasina
practice or the nimitta that appears when doing non-visualization-based
practice), has started to pulse in recent weeks, starting synchronized with
the breath but then shifting a bit so the pulses are coming before or after
the breath, and sometimes much faster than the breath (like it's trying to
sync with my heartbeat instead, maybe). All of this seems to be expected
according to what I've read so I'm not concerned about it, it's just
interesting.</p>
<h2 id="2020-12-21">2020-12-21</h2>
<p>Decided to really try fire kasina practice last night not give up on it. I
went at it for 25 minutes, took a break for a couple minutes, then another 20
minutes. After the first two or three cycles (stare at the flame in one spot
for around 30-60 seconds, close eyes, focus on what happens) it got
interesting. The little dot would be reddish, surrounded by a soft pale blue
circle, and then the dot would vanish taking the aura with it, then come back
much more stable and red, then sometimes a little bit of yellowish white would
appear in the middle and the whole thing would spin. MCTB describes that as
having a gold star in the center, but to me it looked more like a laser
pointer dot that got slightly deeper red and larger, shaped like a stylised
flower outline filled with yellowish white. The dot didn't like to stay in one
spot, and would usually drift off to the upper right, but I could move it
around by moving my head from side to side, the dot would follow a second or
two later. I could also put my right hand up like some kind of mudra, in front
of my face, and it seemed to work as a barrier than the dot didn't want to
pass through when it was moving around. That's about as far as I got, but it
seems promising.</p>
<h2 id="2020-12-19">2020-12-19</h2>
<p>My weekend practice is usually lacking, due I think mostly to my neighbors'
loud music. I've started reading the Vimuttimagga while I wait for it to
quiet down, and as a theoretical warm-up to the Visuddhimagga, which I'd like
to get through sometime this coming year. Of course, the most important thing
is actually doing the work, not just reading about it. Maybe some
industrial-grade earplugs would help.</p>
<p>Something else that's been happening on and off in the past week or two is
seeing other random visualizations. These aren't something I'm intending to
see, but I think mantra practice combined with trying to examine the nimitta
does something a little weird. I'll usually see things that remind me of the
style of Chinese or maybe Korean paintings of dragons, tigers, etc., from
maybe the 15th-18th century or so; not that I'm seeing dragons or tigers
specifically, but beings that look like they could've popped out of one of
those paintings, and usually only for a few moments.</p>
<h2 id="2020-12-18">2020-12-18</h2>
<p>Last night I got started late due to work, so was worried I wouldn't have
time before needing to get to sleep. I tried to maintain mindfulness during
everyday activities (washing, washing; brushing, brushing; left foot, right
foot, left foot, turning, turning). Before bed, I sat doing concentration
practice with the prajnaparamita mantra (gate gate paragate parasamgate bodhi
svaha), initially in sync with the breath but then diverging. After around 40
minutes, the discomfort in my knees and hips was becoming hard to ignore, and
since I had resolved to stick to samatha practices, rather than try to
examine the pain I decided to recline, and I also switched to a simpler
mantra (buddho). About ten minutes into this, the mantra sort of faded into
the background, replaced by some common early visuals (white swirling light
type stuff). I focused on that a bit more, and suddenly had a shallow mental
image of spinning lights, like a carousel without horses or riders and with
long tassels of Christmas lights along and slung out from its ceiling, in
bright colors. That shallow mental thought almost immediately solidified into
a concrete visualization which seemed extremely real (I was fully aware that
it wasn't truly there, but it had depth and seemed to really be there). My
eyes were still closed, but I could clearly see it spinning along where my
wall and ceiling met. A deep sense of happiness and something like awe struck
me, I felt it heavily in my chest. The whole experience lasted for probably
less than a second, but it was extremely intense. Afterwards, I at first
tried to cling to it for a breath or two, but then realized that was the
point; it was over and I needed to understand that it was never going to be
permanent. I went back to focusing on the mantra (buddho) for another ten or
fifteen minutes before going to sleep.</p>
<hr />
<h2 id="2020-12-17">2020-12-17</h2>
<p>Last night I had very little luck, but the night before a strange
visualization happened. Out of the fuzzy/swirly black and white field, in the
bottom right corner, I clearly saw some sort of black-clothed figure. The
clothing was like something out of a fantasy movie, a wispy robe with long
trailers or tatters that were blowing in all directions and pushing into or
overlapping part of the mostly white field behind my eyelids. This was after
a good amount of time doing mantra practice. No idea what it means except
maybe that my ability to concentrate is improving.</p>

<p>I don't think there's much value in adding entries to this log unless
something notable happened, so I'll be skipping days here.</p>

<p>The past couple of days have been extraordinarily stressful, and that will
probably continue for at least the next few weeks. I'm finding that eyes-open
meditation in daily life can help somewhat. Mantra meditation, even for 3-5
minutes if done sincerely, seems to slow everything down and chill everything
out.</p>

<p>Since I usually meditate before going to sleep, most of the entries here will
probably be written the next day about the previous night. I attempted to
reproduce the experience from the 12th (or 10th or 11th, not sure of the
exact date). I didn't set a firm resolution when I got started, so I bounced
between different mantras and the breath for a few minutes, but eventually
stabilized on "bu-dho" again, while reclining. After maybe five minutes, I
was able to interact with the nimitta in interesting ways. I could move it
around with my will, though it didn't always respond exactly the way I
thought it would, and not always immediately. I also tried using my hands to
move it and shape it, with similar results. I could vaguely make out the
shape of my hands (my eyes were closed and this was in a dark room, so it was
a mental image), and they were definitely larger than usual, and seemed to be
made out of some sort of darkness (not in a creepy way, just in a way that
contrasted with the nimitta). I could squeeze, shape, poke, and swirl around
the light in this way. I don't know if this had any value, but it was an
interesting experience. I tried to use this to jump into insight practice by
trying to notice aspects of the three characteristics, but then my
concentration fell apart and it ended. I think I'm pretty weak on both the
concentration and insight sides of practice, but making some progress.</p>

<p>Some background since I started the log late: I started meditating more over
last winter, but didn't really make it anywhere until spring or maybe early
summer 2020. I'd used some basic sort of mindfulness practice years ago in
therapy, but got back into the idea after reading "Why Buddhism Is True". I
also read some of the major Mahayana and Theravada sutras, then MCTB1, TMI,
and then MCTB2, all of which made a big impact. I've attended (online) sangha
on and off (a Plum Village one mostly), and have tried out techniques from
various traditions. After trying noting practice for a while, and also trying
to find the beginnings and ends of breaths as emphasized in parts of TMI, I
realized there was something to this stuff. Basically, when they say "if you
follow these instructions you will get these results", they mean it. So I'm a
believer now. All of the map theory in MCTB is very interesting to me, and I
think, using the main maps Dr. Ingram presents there, it would be reasonable
to say that I had an A&amp;P event when I was 14 (in a Christian context), and
spent the following 15 years or so dealing with the Dark Night. That lines up
too well with my experience to completely discount it, anyway. So now my
focus is on moving past that, but also in learning and experimenting with
these different techniques. Kasina meditation sounds very handy, so I think
I'll want to read the Visuddhimagga and Vimuttimagga sometime soon, too. I
don't know enough, doctrinally, to say I absolutely belong with one specific
tradition or lineage, but Theravada techniques seem to work for me, but I
also like some of the aspects of Chan/Thien/Zen, and am starting to
appreciate the Vajrayana. Maybe I'm en Ekayana Buddhist, if there is such a
thing.</p>

<p>Not sure of the exact date, could be the 10th or 11th too. This comes a few
days after taking the bodhisattva vows (on the 5th). These days were
high-tension. I had been having trouble solidifying the breath as an object.
This night, I tried mantra instead — initially the prajnaparamita mantra from
the heart sutra, I think, but then I switched to just "bu-dho" with the in
and out breath. After maybe 3 or 4 minutes of this, things had become really
thick and syrupy, like my perception was muffled but in a pleasant way, but
it also took some effort to clearly mentally "hear" the mantra. But then as
soon as I noticed that muffled/thick quality, it was like that warm
yellow-brown thickness got cleaned out in an instant, and everything was
clear. I could hear "bu-dho" clearly but didn't feel like I needed to focus
on it as much, and mentally there was a feeling of crispness, like the brown
and yellow had been replaced with a cool blueish white and deep black. That
change startled me enough that I wasn't able to stay in it, though. I don't
know if this was just making it into the first jhana, or mind and body (I
wasn't really doing anything like noting practice so I assume not), but it
felt like progress, so I hope I can do it again.</p>
