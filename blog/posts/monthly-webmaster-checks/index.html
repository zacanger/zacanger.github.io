<p>As the list is generic it doesn't describe how to perform the check, or what you are looking for, and doesn't cover checks on more functional/interactive websites like ecommerce.</p>
<p>The list includes a mixture of critical and merely &quot;improvement-oriented&quot; things to look at: if you are not sure what is critical and what not, that's a good question for your webmaster to work on!</p>
