<hr>
<p>Last night's dream was intense. It involved time travel (in a sort of low-key, totally sensible way, though), some traumatic-ish experiences that took place in my old old home in Baltimore, and my closest friend (and traumatic experiences from <em>her</em> childhood), but basically the message was the same as in the past. I'm very very attached to a few people, and the idea of life without them is horrifying.</p>
<p>This blog isn't read by anyone, but if those people did happen to come across it, I hope they know who they are. I don't want to lose you. You matter to me, quite a lot. I love you.</p>
