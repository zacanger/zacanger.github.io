      <p>You know, I have the strangest dreams. (Good morning/afternoon, incidentally.)
My super smart dream interpreter--myself, while in the shower having existential
crises and trying to figure everything out--has explained the past several
weeks' worth exactly the same way. I don't want to lose people.</p>
<hr />
<p>Last night's dream was intense. It involved time travel (in a sort of low-key,
totally sensible way, though), some traumatic-ish experiences that took place in
my old old home in Baltimore, and my closest friend (and traumatic experiences
from <em>her</em> childhood), but basically the message was the same as in the past.
I'm very very attached to a few people, and the idea of life without them is
horrifying.</p>
<p>This blog isn't read by anyone, but if those people did happen to come across
it, I hope they know who they are. I don't want to lose you. You matter to me,
quite a lot. I love you.</p>
