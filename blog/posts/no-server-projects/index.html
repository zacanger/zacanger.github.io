      <p><strong>HELLO</strong>, and welcome to another episode of <em>Zac's Blogtime with the<br />
Blogginess!</em>.</p>
<p>This week and into next week, we (the DM7 cohort in the immersive course at<br />
<a href="http://devmounta.in">DevMountain</a>) are working on our no-server projects.<br />
They are, basically, front-end based projects. Without servers. As you<br />
might've guessed from the name.</p>
<hr />
<p>For my part, I'm working on a<br />
<a href="https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/">Markdown</a> editor. Initially it<br />
started as a total ripoff of my favourite (and probably the all-around best)<br />
Markdown editor on the web these days, <a href="http://dillinger.io">Dillinger</a>.<br />
Dillinger is simple and beautiful and basically perfect. Two panes, one with<br />
the actual editor component and one with a preview. It has integration with<br />
various cloud storage options (Dropbox and the like), which is nifty, and is<br />
also 100% <a href="https://github.com/joemccann/dillinger">open source</a>, so it was<br />
very easy to dig into it and see how it all works (except for that thing where<br />
there are literally <a href="https://github.com/joemccann/dillinger/branches">78 fucking<br />
branches</a>, which is just<br />
like... wow, people, someone please do some basic maintenance on this repo,<br />
would you?).</p>
<p>What differentiates my editor (or will, when it's done), is the integration of<br />
<a href="http://gpl.internetconnection.net/vi/">jsvi</a>, a really awesome script that<br />
brings vi-like keybindings and commands to the boring old <code>&lt;textarea&gt;</code>. As I<br />
get more into this, I plan on rewriting the jsvi component, bringing it down<br />
in size and scope, and making it not-default. Right now it's not even enabled.</p>
<p>I also plan to write my own version of a Markdown parser. Currently I'm using<br />
<a href="https://github.com/chjj/marked">Marked</a>, which is fantastic and used by just<br />
about everything, but I'd like to implement a <a href="https://github.com/tanakahisateru/js-markdown-extra">JS version of Markdown<br />
Extra</a>, but rewritten<br />
from scratch.</p>
<p>All of that is in the future. right now <a href="https://github.com/zacanger/markvi">my<br />
app</a> does the basics.</p>
<p>I've also been working on a sort of blog platform using<br />
<a href="Angular"><a href="http://angularjs.org">http://angularjs.org</a></a>, with a <a href="Firebase"><a href="https://www.firebase.com/">https://www.firebase.com/</a></a><br />
as a temporary backend. The <a href="https://github.com/zacanger/44y">project for<br />
that</a> isn't much more than auth and posting<br />
right now, but when combined with the Angular Markdown/vi project, I might<br />
have something kind of fun here.</p>
<p>The final future component of all of this will be a desktop app, built on<br />
<a href="http://electron.atom.io/">Electron</a>, using the<br />
<a href="http://photonkit.com/">Photon</a> toolkit. Though that's definitely in the<br />
future, since it's all written in HTML, CSS, and Javascript, I think I might<br />
be able to have something functional up by Wednesday (when the no-server<br />
projects are due).</p>
<p>If this works well enough, I'd like to get rid of goddamn Firebase and work on<br />
my own back-end. That could easily become my main 'personal project' here, and<br />
be more than presentable to potential employers, maybe.</p>
<p>Anyway, these are all just thoughts. I feel completely overwhelmed with<br />
knowledge lately, practically drowning in new information. But it's good. I'm<br />
learning so so so much, and I know there are people here who know a hell of a<br />
lot more than I do, but I'm also solidly in the top 10 in my cohort, or maybe<br />
even the top five, so that's encouraging.</p>
<p>Bah, I'll cut this blog post as short as all the rest--it's awfully difficult<br />
to type with one hand while managing a phone with the other and also trying to<br />
fix myself a tuna sandwich.</p>
<p>I'm really really excited to be here, finally. Things are going well, and I<br />
think I'm actually sort of making social contacts, which is extremely<br />
important since I'm kinda tryna get myself employed here. If I can keep my<br />
friends alive and also manage to get out of the job of playing therapist to<br />
everyone for a little bit, I might actually accomplish real things and come<br />
out of this as an actual developer. I think I could be really actually quite<br />
good, if those things can happen.</p>
