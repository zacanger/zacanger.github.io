<p>This week and into next week, we (the DM7 cohort in the immersive course at <a href="http://devmounta.in">DevMountain</a>) are working on our no-server projects. They are, basically, front-end based projects. Without servers. As you might've guessed from the name.</p>
<hr>
<p>For my part, I'm working on a <a href="https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/">Markdown</a> editor. Initially it started as a total ripoff of my favourite (and probably the all-around best) Markdown editor on the web these days, <a href="http://dillinger.io">Dillinger</a>. Dillinger is simple and beautiful and basically perfect. Two panes, one with the actual editor component and one with a preview. It has integration with various cloud storage options (Dropbox and the like), which is nifty, and is also 100% <a href="https://github.com/joemccann/dillinger">open source</a>, so it was very easy to dig into it and see how it all works (except for that thing where there are literally <a href="https://github.com/joemccann/dillinger/branches">78 fucking branches</a>, which is just like... wow, people, someone please do some basic maintenance on this repo, would you?).</p>
<p>What differentiates my editor (or will, when it's done), is the integration of <a href="http://gpl.internetconnection.net/vi/">jsvi</a>, a really awesome script that brings vi-like keybindings and commands to the boring old <code>&lt;textarea&gt;</code>. As I get more into this, I plan on rewriting the jsvi component, bringing it down in size and scope, and making it not-default. Right now it's not even enabled.</p>
<p>I also plan to write my own version of a Markdown parser. Currently I'm using <a href="https://github.com/chjj/marked">Marked</a>, which is fantastic and used by just about everything, but I'd like to implement a <a href="https://github.com/tanakahisateru/js-markdown-extra">JS version of Markdown Extra</a>, but rewritten from scratch.</p>
<p>All of that is in the future. right now <a href="https://github.com/zacanger/markvi">my app</a> does the basics.</p>
<p>I've also been working on a sort of blog platform using <a href="Angular">http://angularjs.org</a>, with a <a href="Firebase">https://www.firebase.com/</a> as a temporary backend. The <a href="https://github.com/zacanger/44y">project for that</a> isn't much more than auth and posting right now, but when combined with the Angular Markdown/vi project, I might have something kind of fun here.</p>
<p>The final future component of all of this will be a desktop app, built on <a href="http://electron.atom.io/">Electron</a>, using the <a href="http://photonkit.com/">Photon</a> toolkit. Though that's definitely in the future, since it's all written in HTML, CSS, and Javascript, I think I might be able to have something functional up by Wednesday (when the no-server projects are due).</p>
<p>If this works well enough, I'd like to get rid of goddamn Firebase and work on my own back-end. That could easily become my main 'personal project' here, and be more than presentable to potential employers, maybe.</p>
<p>Anyway, these are all just thoughts. I feel completely overwhelmed with knowledge lately, practically drowning in new information. But it's good. I'm learning so so so much, and I know there are people here who know a hell of a lot more than I do, but I'm also solidly in the top 10 in my cohort, or maybe even the top five, so that's encouraging.</p>
<p>Bah, I'll cut this blog post as short as all the rest--it's awfully difficult to type with one hand while managing a phone with the other and also trying to fix myself a tuna sandwich.</p>
<p>I'm really really excited to be here, finally. Things are going well, and I think I'm actually sort of making social contacts, which is extremely important since I'm kinda tryna get myself employed here. If I can keep my friends alive and also manage to get out of the job of playing therapist to everyone for a little bit, I might actually accomplish real things and come out of this as an actual developer. I think I could be really actually quite good, if those things can happen.</p>
