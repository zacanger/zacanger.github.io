      <p>I'll need to edit this script a bit more. Needing to delete all the filler text
isn't a HUGE deal... if you use a real editor. I mean. It's not a huge deal now,
but nano's not exactly... powerful. I could actually just <code>^^</code> start a mark, and
then get to where I need to be, and <code>^k</code> cut it... it's the getting aroudn that
doesn't work so well. Home and end work sort of as expected, but <code>^Space^</code> and
<code>M-Space</code> to go forward/back one word? No, thank you.</p>
<p>Okay, I just wanted to make a note, basically, that I should get <a href="http://zcn.gr">http://zcn.gr</a>
at some point. Also, in sticking my head back into the whole
<a href="http://mickeyswholesalepizza.com">Mickey's</a> project today, I remembered why I
don't much like Bootstrap. It's not that it doesn't work, because it does, and
it works <strong>very</strong> well, if you use it exactly as intended or have a large
enough project to actually need something that complex and... uh... large. But
otherwise it's like using a CMS to run a (small, personal) blog. Why do it?
Mickey's isn't a big project, and I know it would've been ten times easier to
just do it from scratch from the start, but at this point I'm sticking with
BS3 because I need to be able to hand the whole thing over to someone else all
documented and sort of making sense--and they're going to have lovely task of
trying to hunt down, obtain, and beautify some sort of actual content for this
thing. (Or, y'know, maybe they'll just not touch it for another ten years and
leave up the sort-of-filler with which I'll have to deliver it).</p>
<p>It's not all bad, though. I've learned more on this than I thought I would,
specifically in the dealing-with-other-humans area. Mostly, actually, that I'm
not very good at it, and that if given a certain amount of leeway, people will
take every last second right up until an unbendable deadline to start actually
paying attention. (That includes myself; I'm leaving for school in a week, and
I'm fairly certain <em>I don't know enough Javascript to do things, like, really
at all</em>.)</p>
<p>I suppose I ought to do something about this thing that I've been doing lately
where I don't sleep, or sleep maybe four hours a night during the week and
then crash for 16 hours on a weekend night/day. That's not healthy, I think.
Hmm.</p>
