      <p>I'll need to edit this script a bit more. Needing to delete all the filler text<br />
isn't a HUGE deal... if you use a real editor. I mean. It's not a huge deal now,<br />
but nano's not exactly... powerful. I could actually just <code>^^</code> start a mark, and<br />
then get to where I need to be, and <code>^k</code> cut it... it's the getting aroudn that<br />
doesn't work so well. Home and end work sort of as expected, but <code>^Space^</code> and<br />
<code>M-Space</code> to go forward/back one word? No, thank you.</p>
<p>Okay, I just wanted to make a note, basically, that I should get <a href="http://zcn.gr">http://zcn.gr</a><br />
at some point. Also, in sticking my head back into the whole<br />
<a href="http://mickeyswholesalepizza.com">Mickey's</a> project today, I remembered why I<br />
don't much like Bootstrap. It's not that it doesn't work, because it does, and<br />
it works <strong>very</strong> well, if you use it exactly as intended or have a large<br />
enough project to actually need something that complex and... uh... large. But<br />
otherwise it's like using a CMS to run a (small, personal) blog. Why do it?<br />
Mickey's isn't a big project, and I know it would've been ten times easier to<br />
just do it from scratch from the start, but at this point I'm sticking with<br />
BS3 because I need to be able to hand the whole thing over to someone else all<br />
documented and sort of making sense--and they're going to have lovely task of<br />
trying to hunt down, obtain, and beautify some sort of actual content for this<br />
thing. (Or, y'know, maybe they'll just not touch it for another ten years and<br />
leave up the sort-of-filler with which I'll have to deliver it).</p>
<p>It's not all bad, though. I've learned more on this than I thought I would,<br />
specifically in the dealing-with-other-humans area. Mostly, actually, that I'm<br />
not very good at it, and that if given a certain amount of leeway, people will<br />
take every last second right up until an unbendable deadline to start actually<br />
paying attention. (That includes myself; I'm leaving for school in a week, and<br />
I'm fairly certain <em>I don't know enough Javascript to do things, like, really<br />
at all</em>.)</p>
<p>I suppose I ought to do something about this thing that I've been doing lately<br />
where I don't sleep, or sleep maybe four hours a night during the week and<br />
then crash for 16 hours on a weekend night/day. That's not healthy, I think.<br />
Hmm.</p>
