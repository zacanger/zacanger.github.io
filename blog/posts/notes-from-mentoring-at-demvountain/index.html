<p><code>%</code> is not <em>exactly</em> modulo, but rather remainder. Eg <code>9 % 3 // 0</code> , or <code>10 % 3 // 1</code></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>var++ === var=var+1</code></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>var-- === var=var-1</code></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>however</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>varTwo = var++</code> would mean <code>varTwo = var</code>, <code>var=var+1</code>, etc. keep in mind.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>and, <code>varTwo = ++var</code> is the same as <code>++var,</code> <code>varTwo = var</code></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>(so, if <code>var</code> is originally one, both <code>varTwo</code> and <code>var</code> are now equal to two).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In other words, <code>++var</code> says 'increment this <code>var</code>; the value of the expression is the final value,'
while <code>var++</code> would mean 'remember var? go ahead and increment it, but the value of the expression
is the original value of <code>var</code>.' <code>var++</code> and <code>++var</code> are the same thing, but when used in an expression,
they'll return differently.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>math using parens works just like math using parens in real life:
those things happen first. convenient, neh?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>mention <code>===</code> vs <code>==</code> ? the book doesn't touch on that early enough.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>in the case of <code>true || whatever</code>, <code>whatever</code> will never be checked;
in the case of <code>false &amp;&amp; whatever</code>, <code>whatever</code> will never be checked. they are evaluated <em>only when necessary</em>.</p>

<h2>Functional JS</h2>
<p>Functions are first-class objects. This means that <code>var foo = 2</code> and <code>var bar = function(quux, baz){return quux + baz}</code>
are equally valid. This isn't exactly special, but it means that (importantly) functions can be passed as arguments.
<code>var fooBar = function(fn, quux, baz){return fn(quux, baz)}</code> is still good, as is the following:</p>
<pre><code class="language-javascript">var sum = function(a, b){
  return a + b
}
var exec = function(fn, a, b){
  return fn(a, b)
}
exec(sum, 28, 98)
</code></pre>
<p>Higher-order functions are functions that <em>return other functions</em>. <code>var stuff = function(things){return function(){return things}}</code>. Closures, for example, always return the same thing, as in <code>var what = stuff(function(){}) ; what() === what()</code>.</p>
<p>A closure's inner function has access to its parent's scope <em>even after the parent function has been returned</em>.
<code>function asdf(){var texty = 'howdy'; function ghjkl(){console.log(texty)}ghjkl()}</code>.</p>

<h2>local and session storage</h2>
<ul>
<li>same api for both, but sessionStorage loses data on browser close.
<ul>
<li><code>storage.getItem(k)</code> returns value for key</li>
<li><code>storage.removeItem(k)</code> removes ''</li>
<li><code>storage.setItem(k, v)</code> stores ''</li>
<li><code>storage.clear()</code> empties storage contents.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>api expects strings, so <em>if needed</em>, implement a wrapper. json.stringify is chill.</li>
</ul>

<h2>mongo</h2>
<ul>
<li>
<p><code>mongod --fork --syslog</code> will throw it in the background</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>from the mongo shell, <code>use admin</code> and <code>db.shutdownServer()</code> to kill. or, just <code>mongod --shutdown</code></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>For Mac users, if they've installed with Ports (or Brew?), this alias would be nice:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>alias mongo-start='mongod --fork --logpath /var/log/mongo.log --logappend --dbpath=/tmp/mongo'</code></li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>

<h2>angular</h2>
<p>Don't design a page, then manuipulate the DOM (as you would in jQuery). Here, we're no longer building websites that we
make expressive and add to with Javascript... we're building applications in the browser, and thinking about
<em>architecting</em> an app, rather than building a website.</p>
<p>Related to that, don't try to build out your site in HTML, CSS, and Javascript (or jQuery, or whatever), and use Angular
for models and controllers. Angular doesn't like that. Angular gets mad. If you're committing to using Angular, you're
committing to learning that DSL, and using it. Angular wasn't built by Javascript people to program in Javascript. It
was designed by Java people for designers to be able to sketch out concepts in the browser.</p>
<p>The <em>view</em> is the official 'record' in Angular. So you never actually change the DOM, except in directives, which are
applied in the view.</p>
<p>Angular's two-way data binding is actually probably it's strongest feature, at least for small apps. Using jQuery, we
might do something like the following to update content based on events:</p>
<pre><code class="language-javascript">$.ajax({
  url : '/thing.json'
, success (data, status) {
    $('ul#log').append('&lt;li&gt;data is here!&lt;/li&gt;')
  }
})
</code></pre>
<p>(where in the HTML we might have <code>&lt;ul id=&quot;log&quot;&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;</code>). In Angular, we'd do:</p>
<pre><code class="language-javascript">$http('/thing.json').then(response =&gt; {
  $scope.log.push({msg : 'data is here!'})
})
</code></pre>
<p>for a view that looks like <code>&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li ng-repeat&quot;thing in log&quot;&gt;{{thing.msg}}&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;</code>.</p>
<p>We could also just have, in our view, something like <code>&lt;input ng-model=&quot;thing.msg&quot;&gt;</code>, and there's our two-way data
binding.</p>
<p>Angular's separation of concerns is very much an MVC-ish architecture. You have a view, a model (representing data), a
service layer (reusable tasks), directives for DOM manipulation, and controllers to just stick it all together. We also
have DI in Angular, which is not at all new, but was a little unusual in client-side code before Angular really took
off. Essentially this just means we're exporting components, and then importing them in some other bit of code.</p>
<p>Something to keep in mind with Angular is that you're essentially compiling your Angular in the browser, into something
your browser's Javascript rendering engine can handle. This is the big reason Angular can have performance problems.
Angular is esssentialy <em>template driven</em> (just another way of saying that it's all about the view, as above). In
traditional sites, we're using unobtrusive Javascript; that is, we build a site, use semantic HTML, style things in a
stylesheet linked into the header, throw all our scripts in a file linked in the footer, and the page still works. In an
Angular app, you're fucked if you don't want/use/have JS, because your entire <code>index.html</code> might only consist of opening
and closing tags, and a couple of links to scripts/styles. Everything is written in Angular, which means you literally
cannot use your thing as a website anymore, because it is not (one clear indicator of this is just how badly hash
routing fucks up a lot of things).</p>
<p>This really goes back to the 'Angular Way' of doing things--Angular isn't a framework for programmers to program; it's
not a framework to make performant, navigable, friendly sites for users to use--it's a DSL for Java developers and
designers to be able to use and comprehend equally well. Angular treats your HTML as if it's code to be compiled. In
that way it deviates from a regular MVC--the view in Angular is actaully mixed into your logic, and usually has its own
logic mixed into <em>it</em>. Angular compiles all of that into standard languages that browsers can actually understand.</p>
<p>Angular has no real solution for itself. If SEO, accessibility, compatibility, maintainability, performance, comformity
(to actual standards), ease of use, best practices, and conventional wisdom are important, Angular's probably not the
best choice. If you need to sketch out an idea and none of those are really a big deal, it's not necessarily a bad
option.</p>
<p>In Angular, you <em>want</em> to use two-way binding (I mean, really, why else use Angular, anymore?). Rather than writing a
function to update a DOM node based on an event, we're binding an element in the template, using either an attribute or
the <code>{{}}</code> notation. So, <code>&lt;input ng-model=&quot;foo.bar&quot;&gt;</code>, and <code>{{&lt;p&gt;{{foo.bar}}&lt;/p&gt;}}</code>. Now, we're sending data from the
view, to the model (<code>$scope.foo.bar</code>), and then sending that to our view.</p>
<p>Services are essentially helper functions, sorta. They're an object that contains data and functions. They're always
singletons. Nuff said.</p>
<p>One really basic way to think about the difference between Angular and many other ways of writing Javascript
applications would be this little summary: 'Don't select... <em>direct.</em>' What I mean is, unlike in jQuery, where you use a
selector to find the elements, and then do things to them, in Angular you write your code <em>in</em> your elements (as in
<code>&lt;button ng-click=&quot;stuff()&quot;&gt;</code>), or simply write your own elements, and plug them in.</p>
<p>Angular's super opinionated about things. If you want to use unobtrusive JS, don't use Angular. Angular's position is
that it's an HTML extension; it's template-driven, declarative, and compiled.</p>
