<p>My to-do list is gigantic, like a whole huge directory tree of several gigabytes full of unfinished stuff.</p>
<p>Somewhere in there, there's rewriting my entire website.</p>
<p>I've just switched from GoDaddy's hosting to my own VPS (a droplet), since GoDaddy's cost was going up by
about 110%. This means I have a LOT more available to me, now. Not quite as much space, but I can run
whatever I need to on my server now, so... I think it's time to finally update everything. I plan on leaving
most things as just plain old static sites (because, let's be honest, no one cares how flashy this crap is
if it takes a year to render it on an old phone). The blog might change a bit, though. I'm still using that
same old script (based originally on <a href="https://github.com/cfenollosa/bashblog">BashBlog</a>, heavily modified
over the past almost-year). Nothing against that script, it does its job and everything, but a 1300-line
shell script to basically turn Markdown into HTML is absurd -- ESPECIALLY since it doesn't include the
parser.</p>
<p>Anyway, here are some notes from the NG-JS meetup a couple of weeks ago. They were lost on my old laptop,
but the SATA-to-USB thingy came in the mail the other day, so I can finally just do something with these.</p>

<h3>Immutable Data Structures</h3>
<p>I didn't really take notes on this, which kinda sucks, but what I really got out of it much more
was a way to get started and some sparked interest. Here's the little bit I did jot down.</p>
<pre><code class="hljs">https://github.com/ryoia/ (functional-frontend-slides/)
purescript, check it out for _real_ sometime.
github.com/mgechev/angular-immutable
stimulus(?) (immutable library?)

what's the _real_ difference between Object.assign() and Object.freeze() ?
</code></pre>
<h3>RxJS</h3>
<p>Nothing against this guy, but... what the hell is he doing? Does he even know? I think he's probably really
intelligent and good at stuff, but is just totally lost right now, being on a stage talking in front of
all these... ten-ish... people.</p>
<p>None of this is exactly new. <a href="https://github.com/zacanger/extras/tree/master/rxjs-frp">Check over here</a> for
a demo from a few months ago, using RxJS.</p>
<pre><code class="hljs">    // observables

    const foo = Rx.Observable.create(observer =&gt; {
      observer.onNext({value : 0}) // kinda like yield
      observer.onCompleted() // done

      return function dispose() {
        // do stuff that needs to be done on done here
        console.log('disposed')
      }
    })

    const bar = foo.(reduce(
      // stuff
    ))

    bar.subscribe(x =&gt; console.log(x))
    // subscribe: consumers

    // .onCompleted(), if called before last yield,
    // nothing else will happen (so throw it inside your slowest or
    // last async function!).

    setTimeout(() =&gt; {
      bar.dispose()
    }, 1000) // discards subscription, then.

    // .delay(1000) holds for ms
    // Rx.Observable.of(val, value, valoo, vlyou)
    // .doOnNext(x =&gt; console.log(x))
    // tap into next in stream, perform action on it
