<p>My to-do list is gigantic, like a whole huge directory tree of several gigabytes full of unfinished stuff.</p>
<p>Somewhere in there, there's rewriting my entire website.</p>
<p>I've just switched from GoDaddy's hosting to my own VPS (a droplet), since
GoDaddy's cost was going up by about 110%. This means I have a LOT more
available to me, now. Not quite as much space, but I can run whatever I need
to on my server now, so... I think it's time to finally update everything. I
plan on leaving most things as just plain old static sites (because, let's be
honest, no one cares how flashy this crap is if it takes a year to render it
on an old phone). The blog might change a bit, though. I'm still using that
same old script (based originally on
<a href="https://github.com/cfenollosa/bashblog">BashBlog</a>, heavily modified over the
past almost-year). Nothing against that script, it does its job and
everything, but a 1300-line shell script to basically turn Markdown into HTML
is absurd -- ESPECIALLY since it doesn't include the parser.</p>
<p>Anyway, here are some notes from the NG-JS meetup a couple of weeks ago. They
were lost on my old laptop, but the SATA-to-USB thingy came in the mail the
other day, so I can finally just do something with these.</p>

<h3>Immutable Data Structures</h3>
<p>I didn't really take notes on this, which kinda sucks, but what I really got
out of it much more was a way to get started and some sparked interest. Here's
the little bit I did jot down.</p>
<pre><code>https://github.com/ryoia/ (functional-frontend-slides/)
purescript, check it out for _real_ sometime.
github.com/mgechev/angular-immutable
stimulus(?) (immutable library?)

what's the _real_ difference between Object.assign() and Object.freeze() ?
</code></pre>
<h3>RxJS</h3>
<p>Nothing against this guy, but... what the hell is he doing? Does he even know?
I think he's probably really intelligent and good at stuff, but is just
totally lost right now, being on a stage talking in front of all these...
ten-ish... people.</p>
<p>None of this is exactly new. <a href="https://github.com/zacanger/extras/tree/master/rxjs-frp">Check over
here</a> for a demo from
a few months ago, using RxJS.</p>
<pre><code>// observables

const foo = Rx.Observable.create(observer =&gt; {
  observer.onNext({value : 0}) // kinda like yield
  observer.onCompleted() // done

  return function dispose() {
    // do stuff that needs to be done on done here
    console.log('disposed')
  }
})

const bar = foo.(reduce(
  // stuff
))

bar.subscribe(x =&gt; console.log(x))
// subscribe: consumers

// .onCompleted(), if called before last yield,
// nothing else will happen (so throw it inside your slowest or
// last async function!).

setTimeout(() =&gt; {
  bar.dispose()
}, 1000) // discards subscription, then.

// .delay(1000) holds for ms
// Rx.Observable.of(val, value, valoo, vlyou)
// .doOnNext(x =&gt; console.log(x))
// tap into next in stream, perform action on it
