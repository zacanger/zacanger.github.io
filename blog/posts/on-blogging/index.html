      <p>this is, i think, the first post of this year. happy 2016! i'm not blogging a<br />
whole lot, but really just trying to kill a few minute while my brain rests.<br />
lately i'm working a lot in new technologies that i've never touched<br />
before--react, which i still find irksome (though as before, i do <em>get</em> it),<br />
coffeescript (to play with the atom editor), firebase (still more magicc than<br />
really cool, but it does what it does, and we need what it does, so i'm using<br />
it), and some other new things.  but i wanted to take a minute off to talk about<br />
writing.</p>
<hr />
<p>i'm not a writer. i'm okay with words, and i know a lot of them, and i use them,<br />
frequently. usually pretty well, i think. i don't usually know what i'm going to<br />
be saying before i start writing, though. half the time i'm taking notes on<br />
something, and realise later on that my notes might be useful to someone, at<br />
some point, maybe a little bit. you don't need to know what you're trying to<br />
achieve when you start writing, <em>especially</em> if we're talking about a blog post.<br />
you don't need an outline, a muse, a spark of inpsiration, an addiction, a<br />
message, a mission, or even an attention span. it's okay to ramble. it's okay to<br />
not know what you're doing. a lot of the time, writing things down is a really<br />
good way to figure that bit out. i had no idea how i felt about certain<br />
technologies until i started trying to explain, in words understandable to other<br />
people, how i felt about them, and why. things make a lot more sense when you<br />
can read your own thoughts, see them in front of you, and see which ones make<br />
zero sense.</p>
<p>blogs are a really great way to learn things. they don't necessarily have to<br />
take the form of tutorials for that. think about the last time you took notes<br />
on something while trying to learn it. could those notes be helpful to someone<br />
else? why? is it because you're an expert on the subject? probably not. it's<br />
probably because someone could have a chance to see <em>how</em> you learned<br />
something, how you came to understand it. that's pretty cool. words are all<br />
about describing things. kind of why the exist, and stuff. finding the right<br />
words to accurately, thoroughly, and <em>concisely</em> describe something is a<br />
powerful skill. if you can do that, you should, even if you don't think you<br />
have anything worth talking about. let people learn from your notes.</p>
<p>i'm gonna go ahead and just put a nice quote in, here.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>language accelerates learning and creation by permitting communcation and<br />
coordination. a new idea can be spread quickly if someone can explain it and<br />
communicate it to others before they have to discover it themselves. but the<br />
chief advantage of language is not communication but autogeneration.<br />
language is a trick that allows the mind to question itself; a magic mirror<br />
that reveals to the mind what the mind thinks; a handle that turns a mind<br />
into a tool. with a grip on the slippery, aimless activity of self-awareness<br />
and self-referene, language can harness a mind into a fountain of new ideas.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>well, that's pretty cool.</p>
