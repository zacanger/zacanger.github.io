      <p>Functional programming is the new hotness these days. It's also the old hotness.<br />
It's just pretty hot, really. Everyone wants to have a more functional codebase,<br />
and that's a good thing. Less side-effecty, easier to hold in your head, etc.;<br />
the benefits of FP have been thoroughly espoused elsewhere. I just have a couple<br />
of things to add about learning functional programming, especially if you're<br />
coming from another paradigm or a mixed-paradigm language (like JS).</p>
<h2>You (Probably) Don't Need To Learn Another Language</h2>
<p>Languages like Haskell are really neat. They'll change the way you think about<br />
writing code. But you don't need to learn a classically functional language to<br />
learn functional programming.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="kr">module</span> <span class="nn">Main</span> <span class="kr">where</span>
<span class="kr">import</span> <span class="nn">System.Environment</span>

<span class="nf">main</span> <span class="ow">::</span> <span class="kt">IO</span> <span class="nb">()</span>
<span class="nf">main</span> <span class="ow">=</span> <span class="kr">do</span>
  <span class="n">args</span> <span class="ow">&lt;-</span> <span class="n">getArgs</span>
  <span class="n">putStrLn</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="s">&quot;Hello &quot;</span> <span class="o">++</span> <span class="n">args</span> <span class="o">!!</span> <span class="mi">0</span><span class="p">)</span>
</pre></div>

<p>If a block of code like that looks pretty foreign, that's okay. <em>You can program<br />
functionally in whatever language is most familiar to you</em>. Probably. If you're<br />
a C# dev or Rubyist or something, maybe you should look into something a little<br />
less strictly OO, but if you already write JS (for example), you don't need to<br />
go learn about abstract algebra and what stuff like <code>Foo :: [Bar] -&gt; Baz Quux</code><br />
means. Which leads into thought number two:</p>
<h2>A Better Type System Doesn't Make A Language Functional</h2>
<p>Yeah, languages like Idris and Haskell and other super mathy things are great<br />
for functional programming, but you don't <em>need</em> super complex type systems to<br />
program functionally. They're just, y'know, pretty nice. Look at<br />
<a href="https://racket-lang.org/">Racket</a>, for example. You can have static typing<br />
(with <code>#lang typed/racket</code>) but you don't <em>have</em> to. Similarly, you can program<br />
functionally just fine in plain old JS, and you can write super imperative code<br />
in TypeScript. My point is, type systems don't make a language more functional,<br />
they make a language have a different type system.</p>
<h2>Lots Of Languages Have A REPL</h2>
<p>LISP people like to talk about their REPL a lot. Same with Haskell folks,<br />
they'll tell you to go experient in GHCI. That's great, it really is. The REPL,<br />
for any given language, should be one of the primary tools you use to figure<br />
things out. But most languages have one. If you do Python, you're probably<br />
familiar with it. Same with Ruby (irb or pry). Node's REPL, while a little<br />
limited compared to GHCI, is still pretty fantastic. Racket's is very basic, but<br />
if you <code>(require xrepl)</code> it ends up being very pleasant. Having a decent REPL<br />
isn't a functional language feature, it's just a language ecosystem feature.</p>
<h2>Scheme Is Really Nice</h2>
<p>I'm not a LISPer. I've just started learning Racket, which I chose because it's<br />
very compact compared to, say, ClojureScript (which also looks fantastic, by the<br />
way). But coming primarily from JavaScript, Scheme (Racket is a Scheme) is a<br />
really good way to get into FP in another language. Haskell, ML, Idris, etc.,<br />
are all awesome languages, but Scheme might be a better way to break into<br />
functional languages for a lot of folks. Give it a shot sometime.</p>
