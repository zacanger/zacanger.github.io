      <p>at work, parallels kept crashing. what led to this:
* took a system update on the mac from the app store
* after rebooting, went over to parallels, which runs windows 10
* that needed an update too apparently, so took that
* after rebooting the virtual windows, didn't think about it for a while
* went back to it, went to un-suspend or whatever you'd call it, and it crashed
* happened several times, tried force quitting, killing all related processes, rebooting the mac, no luck
* the fix on the kb was totally unrelated. running prd_client_app manually gave the following:</p>

<p>most of that is probably irrelevant, apparently that class is implemented in both thingy
is gui related, found a lot of other stuff about that that had nothing to do with actually crashing.
anyway, the thing that actually ended up working was:</p>
<p><code>sudo "/Applications/Parallels Desktop.app/Contents/MacOS/inittool" init -b "/Applications/Parallels Desktop.app"</code></p>
<p>note: run that as sudo from your normal user, don't <code>sudo su</code> and then do it.</p>
<p>after that, i just opened parallels again and it worked. so. idk. no issues since.
if anyone else can't get anything to work, maybe that'll help.</p>
