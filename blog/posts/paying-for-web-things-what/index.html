      <p>Another not-new post; from when I signed up for Pinboard, about a month ago.</p>
<h3>I Don't Know What I'm Doing</h3>
<p>I've never actually paid for online services. I don't really see the need to; if<br />
there's something that looks nifty, I'll usually figure out a way to do that<br />
thing myself. I'm really hoping Pinboard is going to be worth it. Not that the<br />
money is actually a big deal, or even, like, a little deal. $25 is nothing,<br />
especially spread over a year, and especially taking into account how much more<br />
productive I'll hopefully be without spending hours every week just trying to<br />
access bookmarks (some of which I actually do need).</p>
<p>So this'll be the first test. What implementation of Markdown are we using,<br />
here? Let's find out.</p>
<hr />
<p>(You didn't need to see all that. I just checked with the full syntax<br />
references from a few different kinds of md. Looks like we're using <a href="http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/syntax.text">the<br />
original</a>, here.<br />
Which is fine, of course, though I wouldn't've said no to some nice table<br />
support.)</p>
<p>I didn't even know this had notes, though. So that's just a bonus. I'll have<br />
to check the API docs in a minute and see if there's an easy way to grab them;<br />
eventually I'd like to move to syndicating everything <em>out</em> rather than <em>in</em>,<br />
but for the moment having a way to post on one service and it be automatically<br />
cross-posted to equivalents is pretty basic, and essential in any public (or<br />
optionally-public) (micro)blogging thingamajig.</p>
<p>That's really not super important, though. The real question is, how's the<br />
full-text search? That's why I'm here. Because I have just about 80,000<br />
bookmarks. I'm fairly certain only about 20,000 of them are <strong>real</strong><br />
bookmarks, and Chromium's totally screwed-up way of syncing left me with an<br />
absurd amount of duplicates. There's no way I can delete them all, though.<br />
Using an actual in-browser bookmark manager isn't an option,<br />
obviously--browsers aren't database tools, they just have to deal with<br />
databases sometimes--and some really great addons/extensions that've come in<br />
handy in the past are basically worthless once your numbers reach around 5k.<br />
Doing it manually would be totally fine except it's not, apparently. Have you<br />
ever tried to open a really really really large text file and work with it? If<br />
you're a Microsoft user, you don't even need to think about that--of course<br />
not! Notepad can only handle a few megs or something, right? I've managed to<br />
export my bookmarks a few times over the past couple of weeks and get them up<br />
in one editor or another to try to fix things. This new laptop was promising<br />
(no, I didn't get it just to work with my bookmarks). Four times the RAM and<br />
twice the processing power? Hells yes, thought I! But hells no, thought my<br />
computer. I'm not any good with sed, awk, or regular expressions; I'm chained<br />
to screen editors. I'm sure there's <a href="http://xkcd.com/378">some ridiculous keyboard<br />
sequence</a> out there that could help me. I'm sure I could<br />
learn a language that seems to be mostly based on parentheses, masochism, and<br />
egos just to be able to do anything. But I already have an operating system,<br />
so I don't really need a new text editor, thanks. I know the Vimfolks probably<br />
have a plugin for that... but generally speaking I like my editors to be<br />
smaller than full-featured Webkit web browsers (Vim: ~7=840k SLOC,<br />
Qutebrowser: ~32k, <a href="http://openhub.net">source</a> ). Oh, and I don't know any<br />
query languages, because no thanks. SO...</p>
<p>LightTable ended up being my best option, actually. Better than any simpler<br />
graphical text editor (that still supported search-and-replace) using a<br />
variety of widget toolkits (by the way, I don't know how anyone manages to use<br />
Atom productively--running a text editor that wants to be an IDE on JavaScript<br />
means having a text editor with built-in git that's even slower than Chrome,<br />
apparently); and forgoing Vi(m) and whatever-macs means getting into some<br />
really DOS-ish terminal/console editors... or some really basic ones. Though I<br />
gotta say, DAV is a pretty great break from dealing with major problems<br />
like... line numbers... or colour... or features. Seriously, it's perfect for<br />
Markdown.</p>
<p>This little test of a note actually took a really long time to write because:<br />
- I had to look some things up<br />
- I got distracted<br />
- Managing dotfiles so I can just handle them in git for all machines<br />
- People who use Emacs apparently don't understand how sane people use the web<br />
- Exporting bookmarks<br />
And with that in mind, I'mma (manually) cross-post this to Tumblr, and then<br />
hopefully upload about an 80MB HTML file to Pinboard for processing. Oh geez.</p>
