      <p>Project management tools kill productivity. This isn't news. They <em>can</em> help<br />
other people be more aware of what you're doing, which is generally a good thing<br />
(collaborating on projects, managers keeping track of progress, whatever), but<br />
overdoing it with the tools can be seriously detrimental to actually getting<br />
anything done.</p>
<p>I was going to write a much longer post about this, but let me just give you a<br />
list of all things I check several times a day (in the case of Slack, several<br />
times an hour), instead.</p>
<ul>
<li>Wrike (a task/project management thing with the worst UI of any like tool on<br />
  the market)</li>
<li>Trello (not so much anymore, but some people still use it at work, apparently)</li>
<li>Quip (a weird combination of Trello and Excel)</li>
<li>Github Issues/PRs (Issues not so much anymore, though that would be the most<br />
  sensible place to keep track of repo-specific todos)</li>
<li>And of course, Slack</li>
</ul>
<p>Personally I keep track of what I need to do in two places: for personal items,<br />
a JSON file (yes, a JSON file). This means I can use it with my little<br />
<a href="http://npmjs.com/package/lilnote">command-line note-taking app</a>, easily work<br />
with it in any language, whatever. For work tasks, I just keep a giant Markdown<br />
file, using GFM-style task lists. I end up copying things over from one or more<br />
of the above tools into Markdown, where I keep track of them for hours or days<br />
or weeks, then as things are fleshed out, completed, nixed, or whatever, going<br />
back to those tools (usually more than one) to update them.</p>
<p>This is not an efficient workflow. Some of these tools (Quip and Wrike<br />
especially) are so lacking in all the things that make a good project management<br />
app (mainly, simplicity and ease of use) that using them ends up taking more<br />
than half as much time as many of the small tasks.</p>
<p>The last place I worked, we switched to this thing called Droptask. It was so<br />
bad, such a ridiculously complicated UI mess, that myself and some co-workers<br />
just ended up not using it at all, and relied solely on Slack. Picking a (one,<br />
singular) decent tool really makes a difference. Trello's popular because it's<br />
simple and easy. For devs, same goes for Issues.</p>
<p>I meant to write a good bit more about this but I probably don't need to.<br />
Everyone complains about using too many tools all the time, especially devs<br />
using businessy tools. And it's late. So.</p>
