      <p>Note: this is older, but not actually old, just a week or two, pulled from my <a href="http://zacanger.tumblr.com">Tumblr account</a> for testing purposes.</p>
<p>Okay! Here we go.</p>
<h3 id="bloggy-blogtime">BLOGGY BLOGTIME.</h3>
<p>An attempt at this, anyway.  </p>
<p>I NEED A BLOGGING ENGINE.  </p>
<p>Seriously. I mean, static-site compiler. Whatever. There are so many out there, 
but I can't seem to find one that actually works for me. None of them seem
right.  </p>
<p>I'm literally editing text in a javascript bookmarklet that loads the Ace
editor, right now. Which is annoying a little bit, because it's got syntax 
highlighting and errors based on JS, &amp; obviously I'm writing in Markdown, so...
Oh, and I keep automatically returning when before I hit about 80 characters; 
that's kind of dumb. I need to write a new bookmarklet that pulls in Dillinger
or something.  </p>
<p>Hold on, actually....  </p>
<hr />
<h2 id="were-back">WE'RE BACK</h2>
<p>This time in ReText. I forgot why I got rid of this writer for two seconds. Of course, then I remembered; it's slow and not great, and also doesn't want to recognize any style sheets, so I'm stick with blinding-bright-mode all the time. That's okay for the moment, though, this'll only take a bit.  </p>
<p>I've been meaning to blog for real for a while, now. I don't mean Tumblr-style miniblogging (reserving 'micro-' for truly miniscule bits like Twitter and YO); actual blogging, like they used to do. Like <a href="http://ftrain.com">Paul Ford</a>, or people who have things to talk about, or... I dunno, experts.</p>
<h2 id="okay-wow">OKAY WOW</h2>
<p>Shit happens and I get into things that last for days. In this case, probably weeks; it's really just a part of a thing that's been going on for years, actually, so whatever. This hasn't exactly been a great first post, has it? I swear I have valuable things to put on paper! Or at least, to type into Nano (yes, Nano. Shut up, VIM people. And don't even start, Emacs cultists, I already have an OS.). Some things coming up on Zac's magical happyfun blogtime extravaganza:</p>
<ul>
<li>Installing Debian on an ancient Toshiba Satellite</li>
<li>Installing Debian on a less ancient Toshiba Portege</li>
<li>Installing Debian on an HP EliteBook</li>
<li>Installing Debian on everything</li>
<li>Installing Debian in a chroot on an Android phone</li>
<li>Installing other distros, too, on all the devices listed above</li>
<li>Problems with newfangled filesystems on old hardware</li>
<li>All the reasons I don't really the design community</li>
<li>Why Javascript is so ridiculously overrated</li>
<li>Confusion about otherwise intelligent people using Javascript for things better left to, like, shell scripts. Or C. Lol.</li>
<li>More things!</li>
</ul>
<p>So, that'll all be happening. I'mma just pick a blog engine at random here, I guess, because Delposto was close but not really right for me. Even Bashblog, which sounds pretty basic, has too many features and options. Don't want no plugin comment system. Just want a nice looking thingamajig. Mebbe just some Markdown.css and call it a day.  </p>
<p>Oh, I need tagline! Or, whaddaya call it, a signing-off thingy. I used to say this, and it'll do for now:  </p>
<p>Love and tea,<br />
