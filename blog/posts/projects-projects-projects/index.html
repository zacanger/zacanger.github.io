      <p>I haven't really mentioned what I'm actually doing here, yet, a whole lot. Well,<br />
it should be pretty obvious, but it's mostly cramming as much Javascript into my<br />
head as I can possibly handle. THen forgetting some, then relearning it. Lots of<br />
that, over and over again, until eventually a good bit starts to stick. For a<br />
really large list of the stuff I've been working on, I have some public repos on<br />
<a href="https://github.com/zacanger">my Github</a>. The pertinent ones would be the actual<br />
<a href="https://github.com/zacanger/devmtn.git">DevMountain assignments and small<br />
projects</a>, and the <a href="https://github.com/zacanger/excerpts-and-excersises.git">repo full of<br />
extras</a>, things I<br />
wanted to learn or messed around with or whatever, since I've been here.</p>
<p>The bigger things are the no-server and personal projects--and in my case, my<br />
personal project is (at least conceptually) based on the no-server project<br />
(which was, as it sounds, just client-side Angular app.)</p>
<p><img alt="Markvi" src="http://zacanger.com/blog/assets/img/markvi-1.jpg" /></p>
<hr />
<p>This was my no-server project. It's a markdown editor with realtime preview,<br />
based on <a href="https://codemirror.net/">Codemirror</a>, and very unoriginal. The most<br />
interesting thing about it is its vi-like keybindings (which weren't even<br />
working at the time of no-server projects). The editor is available <a href="https://github.com/zacanger/markvi">on<br />
Github</a> and installable <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/markvi">straight from<br />
NPM</a> (<code>npm i markvi &amp;&amp; cd
node_modules/markvi &amp;&amp; npm start</code>). I kind of like it, how it is, just storing<br />
your docs in localstorage, but having decided to scratch the<br />
Tinder-for-the-unemployed idea (only partially because <a href="http://www.jobrapp.com/">it's already been<br />
done</a>), I figured since I've got no other ideas and<br />
don't like the idea of just building an Amazon clone (if someone really needs<br />
that before making a hire, it wouldn't take an absurd amount of time, anyway),<br />
I'd go further with Markvi, and maybe actually finish the damn thing.</p>
<p><img alt="Another view of Markvi" src="http://zacanger.com/blog/assets/img/markvi-2.jpg" /></p>
<p>As it stands, it's not broken, and now it saves to my (live and hosted!)<br />
<del>database</del> document store. I still can't get behind calling Mongo a<br />
database, since it lacks all of the things that make databases useful (and, to<br />
be fair, all of the things that make them horrible). Anyhow, it meets the<br />
requirements for the personal project (MEAN stack, two collections, one ref,<br />
preferably not totally broken), but my cohort seems to be full of very<br />
ambitious people. I knew that we, as a group, would be significantly more<br />
impressive than the previous cohort, but I didn't quite expect to get to a<br />
point where I'd feel... slow.</p>
<p><img alt="as yet unnamed blog app" src="http://zacanger.com/blog/assets/img/ayuba.png" /></p>
<p>So, this is where I'm headed. A native(ish) desktop app, built on either<br />
<a href="http://electron.atom.io">Electron</a> (formerly Atom-Shell) or<br />
<a href="http://nwjs.io/">NW.js</a> (formerly Node-Webkit). That end of things currently<br />
is halfway okay--posts post, the database stores them, but for whatever reason<br />
(the reason is Angular. I blame Angular. Or at least UI-Router, which is still<br />
a gigantic fuckwad of uselessness when it comes to stability or debugging.)<br />
some things just don't render, or render very poorly. It's progress, though!<br />
There's a searchable index of all saved posts for a user (who, right now, is<br />
only authenticated the old-school way, though it should be as quick as<br />
uncommenting a few lines to get Twitter, Github, Google, and Facebook auth<br />
working), though the live filtering of tags isn't working as planned, so I've<br />
temporarily re-removed that from the app. I'm leaning towards Electron, not<br />
exactly out of preference, because I'm neutral to both of them, but just<br />
because its popularity (and the popularity of things based on it, like certain<br />
editors on the market) means it's a lot easier to find good examples,<br />
generators, packagers, and projects I can tear apart and study. I'm also on<br />
the fence about which editing component to use... the stable/production<br />
version of Markvi is using Codemirror, but the more I play with them, the more<br />
I really enjoy the Ace editor. It's heavier, but it feels more solid and<br />
dependable (and I'm biased, since I really like my <a href="https://c9.io/">C9</a><br />
editor/dev box). Seems like a better API and larger community support, too.<br />
Codemirror's great, it really is, and obviously <a href="http://marijnhaverbeke.nl/">the guy who wrote<br />
it</a> is absolutely brilliant, but Ace just feels<br />
more natural, or something. I don't actually have a great reason for that.</p>
<p>That whole project is also available <a href="https://github.com/zacanger/ayuba.git">on<br />
Github</a>, under the temporary name of<br />
<em>"As Yet Unnamed Blog App"</em>. As always, anything that's mine is totally under<br />
whatever license you feel like at the moment (the WTFPL and DBAD are personal<br />
favourites, and they boil down to the same thing, legally: do whatever the<br />
fuck you want, but don't be a dick about it), and if anyone happens to see<br />
this and spot some problems in my code (or solutions to getting things to look<br />
right in Electron?), I'm definitely open to PRs.</p>
<p>Oh, and yeah, I have heard of Ghost. Hush. Ghost doesn't come in a<br />
fully-offline cross-platform binary. Neither does mine, yet, but after the<br />
project presentation (Monday! Eeeeeek...), I'd like to switch to a<br />
filesystem-based store, instead of Mongo (which takes a minimum of 300 megs<br />
for its journal file, unless otherwise specified at the command line), or<br />
maybe a <a href="https://www.meteor.com/mini-databases">MiniMongo</a> or MiniRedis type<br />
of thing (which would be a good excuse to actually use<br />
<a href="https://www.meteor.com/">Meteor</a>, which I like almost as much as I love<br />
<a href="http://vuejs.org/">Vue</a>)... so if I could cut it down to less than a hundred<br />
megs or so total, once wrapped, it could be something... different. I might<br />
even use it, who knows. Whether Ace or Codemirror-based, it'd have a lot of<br />
room for expansion to other languages (another area where I think Ace would do<br />
better than Codemirror, because of Cloud9's support and plugin community).</p>
<p>OKAY. That's all, that's my update. Again, <a href="http://devpost.com/software/markvi">here's my<br />
editor</a> as it currently stands, totally<br />
useable, just click through or <code>npm i markvi &amp;&amp; cd node_modules/markvi &amp;&amp; npm
start</code> and... basically, wish me luck. (As usual, this is said knowing exactly<br />
how many people read this blog--I don't even read the thing, so that's exactly<br />
zero). It's really more of a journal so I have some idea of what the hell I<br />
was doing when I messed up X or how I managed to do Y, than anything else.<br />
Whatever.</p>
