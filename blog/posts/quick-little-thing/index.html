<hr />
<p>I think I may ask about a mentor spot here. Totally made an agreement with a<br />
very intelligent member of my cohort (what we call a class, I guess), signed in<br />
blood, did the whole 'may the devil take my future happiness and also my<br />
chocolate' stuff, and basically we'll both be talking to the head instructor<br />
about both of us getting potential mentor spots, maybe.</p>
<p>Also, it's week 7 now. That means it's half over. There's interim week (aka<br />
everybody goes home for thanksgiving except myself week, apparently), a few more<br />
weeks, then personal project presentations (eek!), xmas (another week-long<br />
break), then three weeks and then DONE. I'd better know my shit by then, because<br />
I really would like to be good enough at this stuff to make a lasting<br />
impression.</p>
<p>Anyway. I've just decided to say FUCK React Native, because I want to make apps<br />
in Javascript, not learn a whole new JS library just to make a horrible ugly<br />
mess with the most PHP-like js they've ever thought up, Java, and bits of<br />
Swift/Objective C. I'll just cry a little bit inside and built this thing with<br />
the traditional MEAN stack, plus Socket.io (or maybe make things easier on<br />
myself and let Meteor do some of the work).</p>
<p>Gotta cut it short--going up to SLC (for the first time since I've come to Utah,<br />
actually) to hit up the Cheesecake Factory and see a comedy show, or some such.<br />
Then probably cry a bit (but quietly, inside), because some people are leaving<br />
(the previous cohort), and I've grown fond of some of those people, and that's<br />
sad.</p>
