      <p>I think I may ask about a mentor spot here. Totally made an agreement with a
very intelligent member of my cohort (what we call a class, I guess), signed
in blood, did the whole 'may the devil take my future happiness and also my
chocolate' stuff, and basically we'll both be talking to the head instructor
about both of us getting potential mentor spots, maybe.</p>
<p>Also, it's week 7 now. That means it's half over. There's interim week (aka
everybody goes home for thanksgiving except myself week, apparently), a few
more weeks, then personal project presentations (eek!), xmas (another
week-long break), then three weeks and then DONE. I'd better know my shit by
then, because I really would like to be good enough at this stuff to make a
lasting impression.</p>
<p>Anyway. I've just decided to say FUCK React Native, because I want to make
apps in Javascript, not learn a whole new JS library just to make a horrible
ugly mess with the most PHP-like js they've ever thought up, Java, and bits of
Swift/Objective C. I'll just cry a little bit inside and built this thing with
the traditional MEAN stack, plus Socket.io (or maybe make things easier on
myself and let Meteor do some of the work).</p>
<p>Gotta cut it short--going up to SLC (for the first time since I've come to
Utah, actually) to hit up the Cheesecake Factory and see a comedy show, or
some such. Then probably cry a bit (but quietly, inside), because some people
are leaving (the previous cohort), and I've grown fond of some of those
people, and that's sad.</p>
