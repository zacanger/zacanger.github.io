      <p>React:<br />
  - Good at managing state.<br />
  - which is to say, dynamism<br />
  - Components, just like... everything else these days, so that's totally irrelevant.<br />
  - virtual dom, which is not exactly facebook's anyway.<br />
  - unidirectional data flow, which is a mouthful.<br />
  - that is, the loop.<br />
  - more boilerplate to run that... less boilerplate-replacer built into react?</p>
<hr />
<p>Random-ass notes and stuff.</p>
<p>Erm. Thus far, it's web architecture 101. Components are a thing. People don't like to refresh whole pages. Etc.</p>
<p>render() == render: function(){}</p>
<p>this.setState = important, should always use</p>
<p>React is a view. But, does server-side rendering. Which is much more up my<br />
alley, because it's not making life miserable for users. We can check that out<br />
when we check out all those other frameworks, for fun.</p>
<p>React is compiled.</p>
<p>Redux is a state container. Which actually makes sense now. Because everything<br />
is state, in React, it seems. So, it abstracts state and manages it<br />
independently from the front-end, which is how React <em>can</em> do it's thing on<br />
the server.</p>
<p>My god, though, React people are worse than Lisp people. Everything has to be<br />
about how they do things better, even when they very clearly just do things at<br />
a totally okay level.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.quora.com/React-JS-Library/How-was-the-idea-to-develop-React-conceived-and-how-many-people-worked-on-developing-it-and-implementing-it-at-Facebook">OH. It turns out that React looks like PHP to be because it was influenced by<br />
XHP</a>.<br />
Which is PHP, influenced by E4X (ECMAScript with random XML all up in it). So<br />
React is Javascript based on PHP based on Javascript based on XML. So it's<br />
totally okay to think that it's hideous. That's good.</p>
<hr />
<p>This note, and some random (a halfway finished tiny little example app) are up<br />
<a href="https://github.com/zacanger/devmountain/tree/master/6/react-meetup">on Github</a>.<br />
I've also got an <a href="https://github.com/zacanger/devmountain/tree/master/6/meteor-react-todos">example to-do list built on Meteor, in<br />
React</a>,<br />
done just as it is in the Meteor docs.</p>
