      <h1>IMPORTANT:</h1>
<p>don't take anything here seriously. i think it's just interesting to reread<br />
my initial reaction when i was confronted with everything that is react.</p>
<hr />
<h2>React Meetup, 17 Nov, 2015</h2>
<p>React:
* Good at managing state.
* which is to say, dynamism
* Components, just like... everything else these days, so that's totally irrelevant.
* virtual dom, which is not exactly facebook's anyway.
* unidirectional data flow, which is a mouthful.
* that is, the loop.
* more boilerplate to run that... less boilerplate-replacer built into react?</p>
<hr />
<p>Random-ass notes and stuff.</p>
<p>Erm. Thus far, it's web architecture 101. Components are a thing. People don't<br />
like to refresh whole pages. Etc.</p>
<p><code>render() == render: function(){}</code></p>
<p><code>this.setState</code> = important, should always use</p>
<p>React is a view. But, does server-side rendering. Which is much more up my<br />
alley, because it's not making life miserable for users. We can check that out<br />
when we check out all those other frameworks, for fun.</p>
<p>React is compiled.</p>
<p>Redux is a state container. Which actually makes sense now. Because everything<br />
is state, in React, it seems. So, it abstracts state and manages it<br />
independently from the front-end, which is how React <em>can</em> do it's thing on the<br />
server.</p>
<p>My god, though, React people are worse than Lisp people. Everything has to be<br />
about how they do things better, even when they very clearly just do things at a<br />
totally okay level.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.quora.com/React-JS-Library/How-was-the-idea-to-develop-React-conceived-and-how-many-people-worked-on-developing-it-and-implementing-it-at-Facebook">OH. It turns out that React looks like PHP to be because it was influenced by XHP</a>.<br />
Which is PHP, influenced by E4X (ECMAScript with random XML all up in it). So<br />
React is Javascript based on PHP based on Javascript based on XML. So it's<br />
totally okay to think that it's hideous. That's good.</p>
