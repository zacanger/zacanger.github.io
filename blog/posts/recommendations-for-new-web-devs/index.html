      <p>Some of these thoughts probably apply to all developers. Some don't.</p>
<ol>
<li>Learn an editor. It doesn't matter which editor. Just learn one. Be good at<br />
   it. I don't care if you use Visual Studio or Emacs or whatever. Be really<br />
   good at the thing you pick, though.</li>
<li>Learn enough <code>vi</code> to get by. You <em>will</em> need to know it, at some point. At<br />
   the very least, learn how to enter text, move around, save, quit, and quit<br />
   without saving.</li>
<li>Install <code>jq</code> (build it from source if you want the newest hotness; otherwise<br />
   install it with your package manager). Don't install the <code>jq</code> clones written<br />
   in other languages (not C) &mdash; most of them are slow and/or only<br />
   half-finished.</li>
<li>Get comfortable with Bash. You don't have to be great with it, just know<br />
   enough to get by. It doesn't matter what shell you actually use (Zsh, Ksh,<br />
   Bash, Sh, Dash, Ash, PowerShell &mdash; I don't care, whatever). If you're<br />
   writing stuff that's going to be run by other people, ever, write it in Bash.<br />
   If you're writing stuff that may or may not be run on a server, write it in<br />
   POSIX-compliant <code>sh</code>.</li>
<li>Spend some time on Twitter. Facebook is for finding out how your<br />
   middle-school best friend's back surgery went. LinkedIn is for collecting<br />
   recruiter spam just in case. Twitter is for following people who say things<br />
   that matter, so get on Twitter.</li>
<li>No one cares if you can't afford a Mac. Macs aren't great computers, they're<br />
   okay computers that are very expensive. If you can't afford a Mac, try Linux<br />
   (I recommend Debian with the XFCE desktop environment, but try other things<br />
   too if you want!). If you don't have time for that, Windows is also okay<br />
   (just remember to tell your editor and Git to use UNIX-style line-endings).</li>
<li>Don't work (for your employer) on the weekends. Work on side projects, if you<br />
   want. Or do other things. Go out to brunch. Climb a mountain. Learn a Primus<br />
   song on bass. Get drunk. Just don't work for the person who pays you to work<br />
   during the week. If they seem to expect you to be working when you're not at<br />
   work, start looking for another job.</li>
<li>Learn other languages. HTML and CSS are not programming languages, so they<br />
   don't count. JS is actually a really great language (so don't take shit from<br />
   Java or C# developers who bitch about it!), but it's only one language. Learn<br />
   another language that helps you think about what you do in a different way.<br />
   Scheme (specifically, Racket) is a really nice one to start with. Haskell is<br />
   interesting (or some other ML-type language, like OCaml or Purescript). C is<br />
   also really useful to know, even if you only ever learn enough to write a<br />
   basic shell or something.</li>
<li>Figure out your own method for managing tasks. Chances are, you'll work for<br />
   more than one company over the next few years. Your employer might be really<br />
   into Jira, or Trello, or whatever, or they might change their mind four times<br />
   a year, but either way, getting heavily invested in one tool is not a great<br />
   idea. Use their thing, but also figure out what works for you. I keep track<br />
   of tasks for work in plain Markdown files, and I use<br />
<a href="http://npm.im/lilnote">lilnote</a> for personal tasks. Just find a thing you<br />
   like and stick with it.</li>
<li>Make time for personal development. Including on the clock. If your employer<br />
   doesn't like that you spend a half hour every morning catching up on what new<br />
   flags Chromium shipped, or competing on Codewars, or whatever other technical<br />
   thing happens to really interest you but might also benefit your company,<br />
   start looking for another job.</li>
