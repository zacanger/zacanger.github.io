<p>The store is an object that holds state. There's only ever one store in Redux,
with many reducers that act on it.</p>
<p><code>getState()</code> returns the state from the store.</p>
<p><code>subscribe(listener)</code> says &quot;Hey, call <code>listener</code> when the state changes.&quot;</p>
<p>There's also a <code>replaceReducer</code> but unless you're writing hot middlware or
something you probably won't touch this one.</p>
<p>State can by any type, though obviously it's probably best to just use an
object here.</p>
<p>Actions are always objects, and they always have a <code>type</code>.</p>
<pre><code class="language-javascript">store.dispatch({type: 'do-stuff'})
// it's conventional to use all uppercase, but it's also hideous. so.
store.dispatch({type: 'DO_OTHER_STUFF', stuff: '[things to do here, maybe]'})
</code></pre>
<p>Action creators are functions that create actions based on any sorts of
arguments.</p>
<pre><code class="language-javascript">const sendSomeData = 'send-some-data'
const sendSomeDataActionCreator = data =&gt; ({
  type : sendSomeData
, data
})
</code></pre>
<p>A 'bound' action creator would be one that creates the action and immediately
dispatches it. This might be familiar to folks who've worked with Flux before.</p>
<p>This is how you might have something like this in Flux:</p>
<pre><code class="language-javascript">const sendMoreData = data =&gt; {
  const doIt = {
    type : sendMoreData,
    data
  }
  dispatch(doIt)
}
</code></pre>
<p>And this is how it'd work in Redux:</p>
<pre><code class="language-javascript">// assuming you already have the dispatch and action creator, you'd just
const boundSendMoreData = data =&gt;
  dispatch(sendMoreData(data))
</code></pre>
<p>There's also a <code>bindActionCreators()</code> to just do this for you, and React-Redux
has <code>connect()</code>.</p>
<p>Async actions should go through middleware to be turned into regular actions
before being dispatched.</p>
<p>Reducers always take state and an action and return state.
<code>reducer (state, action) =&gt; state</code>
These are what they sound like—reducing functions.
The state a reducer takes is your existing (or previous, I guess) state.
Reducers are pure functions.</p>
<p>A dispatch is a function that takes an action (or an async action). It may then
dispatch an action (or actions) which will affect the store.
There's a base <code>dispatch</code> that always sends an action to the reducer.</p>
<p>Middleware are about what you'd expect—functions (HOF) that take a
dispatch function and return a dispatch function.</p>
<p>There are 'store enhancers' that are higher-order functions that take a store
creator and return a different store creator. They're basically kind of a
middleware for the store creator. You probably won't directly use one, ever.
Instead you'll just use the regular store creator (<code>createStore</code>).</p>
