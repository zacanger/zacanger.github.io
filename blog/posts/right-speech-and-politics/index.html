      <p>friendly reminder that while obviously engaged/humanistic buddhism isn't a
problem, the Tathagata specifically instructed bhikkhus to not get into
political topics. it's fine to have opinions, it's fine to even talk about them
sometimes, but not fine to get up on the high seat and talk politics.</p>
<p>i've seen a big uptick recently in talks with elements of wrong speech
concerning other countries or other political or economic systems. sometimes
it's not worth caring about, because it comes from heterodox sects who disregard
the vinaya anyway, but when it comes from orthodox schools, that's truly
concerning. stay attentive to what's coming out of your mouth and be sure it
aligns with the dhamma, and stay attentive to the media you consume and make
sure it's not distorting your mind.</p>
