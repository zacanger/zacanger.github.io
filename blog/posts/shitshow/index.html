      <p>This is an elaboration on a<br />
<a href="https://twitter.com/zacanger/status/796205243474157569">tweet</a> from last night.</p>
<p>I was born male, and I identify as male. That's pretty convenient for me.<br />
I'm white, which is probably very convenient for me.<br />
I make a conscious effort to be aware of my privilege, but I probably fuck up<br />
sometimes. I hope that whenever that happens, someone will call me out on it.</p>
<p>I was born in Baltimore, and went to a public school that I think was less than<br />
half white. That turned out to be a nice thing, because I never really<br />
understood what the big deal was about skin colour. My parents tell me I<br />
literally didn't understand that some people might think there was a difference<br />
between people with different coloured skin. And why would I? I was a kid,<br />
that's not a thing I should have to know.</p>
<p>My family moved to southern Pennsylvania when I was 11. South-Central PA is<br />
overwhemingly white, and has a large boomer population. One could easily go<br />
months at a time without seeing a black person, especially if one was<br />
homeschooled (which I was, because the local schools were some of the worst in<br />
the state).</p>
<p>When I was 19, I was working in the coffee shop in a local grocery store. I had<br />
just voted for the first time. Obama became President. The next morning, I went<br />
to work around 6:30, sold a newspaper to an older guy around 7. He sat down on a<br />
nearby bench and said to me "Can you believe they put a n----- in the White<br />
House?" This wasn't my first time encountering racism, but it was the first time<br />
I realised just how open people in that area were about it.</p>
<p>I worked at a guitar shop for a while. The guy who owned it was a stereotypical<br />
redneck, something straight out of a Far Side comic. To him, anyone non-white<br />
was nothing but an epithet, women existed to be objectified, and if he got a<br />
hint that someone wasn't straight, they wouldn't be allowed in his shop. Most of<br />
his days were spent smoking pot and looking at pictures of girls on the computer<br />
in his office.</p>
<p>I moved to Utah about a year ago. I didn't intend to stay here, because Utah is<br />
all of the bad things people say about it. It's also all of the good things<br />
people say about it&mdash;there are mountains and things, and if you're into<br />
that that's pretty nice&mdash;but it's extremely white, extremely Mormon,<br />
extremely dry, and extremely boring. It's a lot of the things I hated about<br />
Pennsylvania, except drier and with Mormons instead of Evangelicals.</p>
<p>I kind of thought, though, that being out here would be a bit of an escape from<br />
the 'culture' in Pennsylvania. James Carville<br />
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pennsyltucky">described PA</a> as being Philadelphia<br />
and Pittsburgh with Alabama in between, and that's pretty accurate. Utah's more<br />
like Salt Lake City and then a bunch of nothing mixed with Mormons, which isn't<br />
actually any better. Mormons are a little more laid-back about their racism and<br />
mysogyny, but it's still there. They're just encouraged not to show it off,<br />
because the LDS church doesn't want that public image. It's pretty clear based<br />
on their politics, though.</p>
<p>This election was not about anything except for hatred. A common statement is<br />
that Trump just 'tells it like it is,' but that's known to be bullshit. He's<br />
been the most dishonest Presidential candidate in the history of fact-checking,<br />
and Clinton has been one of the most factually accurate, ever, period. Straight<br />
talk has nothing to do with anything. There have also been numbers that say that<br />
Trump supports think the economy will do better under Trump, but generally folks<br />
actually worried about the economy will vote Democrat, probably because the<br />
economy tends to do better under Democrats.</p>
<p>Trump winning the electoral vote last night has nothing to do with policy. It<br />
was a message from the worst kind of people in this country that they want to be<br />
heard and want to be taken seriously. That they're afraid of people who don't<br />
look like them or have the same beliefs as them. People like that old man at the<br />
coffee shop, or various bosses I had in Pennsylvania. People who think they<br />
should have the right to openly discriminate against other people, people who<br />
are so unconcerned with facts that they sound exactly like characters in<br />
Idiocracy (link), calling people 'faggot' for being educated on a topic.</p>
<p>I'm a cis white male, and I'm sorry that a bunch of cis white males did this to<br />
this country. It's going to be really rough, especially at first when we have a<br />
red house and senate. We, collectively, all the people that have fought for<br />
LGBTQA rights and less discrimination and tried to defend against ignorance and<br />
won Clinton the popular vote, we need to hold on and survive this and support<br />
each other. We need to call each other out on our biases and abuse of<br />
privilege We need to not give up. We need to show each other, the country, and<br />
the world that America is not a country of hate.</p>
<p>There are folks on Twitter saying that this will be easy, that love and<br />
happiness and just get through it, and that's bullshit. This won't be easy. This<br />
is serious and dangerous and terrifying. This is bad news all around. But let's<br />
try, because we can't all just leave.</p>
