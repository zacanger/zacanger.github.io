      <h2>Why Read This?</h2>
<p>Why am I qualified to talk about this? There are <em>so many</em> Intro To Vim<br />
posts/articles/whatever out there, so why should you read this one?</p>
<p>This isn't going to be a Vim tutorial. It's more of a guide to guides and a<br />
short overview of resources.</p>
<p>I've been using Vim full-time for around two years now, and used a lot of other<br />
editors before Vim. It took me a while to figure out what I wanted in an editor,<br />
and when I did figure it out it turned out Vim was what I needed. I'm not a Vim<br />
expert, but I'm solid enough with it that I can be much more productive in Vim<br />
than in any other editor. I'm writing this post in Vim because it's far more<br />
comfortable for me now than some other thing with buttons and menus and pointing<br />
and clicking and all that. Vim fits really nicely into the environment and<br />
workflow I already had (entirely terminal-based).</p>
<h2>Do You Really Want To Learn Vim?</h2>
<p>Are you sure? Why do you want to learn Vim? Is it because someone told you your<br />
editor isn't a <em>real</em> editor and <em>real</em> programmers use Vim (or Emacs)? That's<br />
bullshit. Real programmers use whatever tools help them be productive. If you're<br />
already good with your editor, and it suits your needs, stick with it. You<br />
should learn Vim if you're not happy with what you're using now. It doesn't<br />
matter if you use Atom or Emacs or Eclipse or whatever. If you know your editor<br />
well and can get stuff done in it, don't switch editors just because someone<br />
said you should. Learn Vim if you're tired of how resource-heavy Atom is, or you<br />
spend a lot of time sshed into servers, or you just haven't found something that<br />
felt <em>right</em> yet.</p>
<p>That being said, I love Vim, and if you want to learn it, and have the time to<br />
get moving with it, I think you should. I've used loads of editors in the past<br />
(Nano, Notepad++, Kilo/OpenEmacs, Hipper, Atom, LightTable, WebStorm, Visual<br />
Studio, VS Code, TextAdept, Sublime Text, and probably others). They all have<br />
their good parts and their bad parts. So does Vim, but for me the good far<br />
outweighs the bad with Vim (and most of the bad is Vimscript, which is kind of<br />
really rough).</p>
<h2>Where You Should Start</h2>
<p>There are <em>loads</em> of resources for learning Vim out there. A lot of them take<br />
the form of games and such. Ignore all those. They'll only teach you the basics,<br />
usually just of navigation and maybe two modes. They won't help you <em>understand</em><br />
Vim, they'll just teach you enough to be able to open it, enter text, move<br />
around, and quit. If that's all you need in an editor, switch to Notepad or<br />
Nano. Learning how to move and enter text is important, but it's also important<br />
to know why things are the way they are in Vim.</p>
<h2>Vimtutor</h2>
<p>Start with <code>vimtutor</code>. If you're on Linux, BSD, or Mac, you probably already<br />
have it installed. Just type <code>vimtutor</code> in a terminal, and do the whole thing.<br />
You don't have to do it all at once, and you don't have to do it <em>only</em> once. I<br />
think I've gone through it two or three times, and the first time took me three<br />
days, doing just a bit at a time.</p>
<p>If you're on Windows, you'll need to install Vim manually, and then you should<br />
have Vim available under <code>%ProgramFiles%\vim\vim[version]\vimtutor.bat</code>.</p>
<h2>Reading</h2>
<p>Then read<br />
<a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/1218390/what-is-your-most-productive-shortcut-with-vim/1220118#1220118">this</a>.<br />
It explains a lot about how to <em>think</em> about using Vim.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.moolenaar.net/habits.html">This bit</a>, from the guy who wrote Vim<br />
originally, is also worth a read.</p>
<p>Then go <a href="https://github.com/mhinz/vim-galore">read this</a>. There's a <em>lot</em> of<br />
information there. You don't need to remember it all, but it's a handy<br />
reference.</p>
<p>If you get stuck at any point, use the built-in help (with <code>:h thing</code>, like <code>:h
reg</code>). The help in Vim is <em>great</em>, probably better than any other editor's. You<br />
should get in the habit of checking the help before Googling something, because<br />
the help is probably more accurate, and is also closer at hand.</p>
<h2>Which Vim?</h2>
<p>Most OSs will come with some version of Vim already installed (the exception<br />
being Windows). Chances are it's a stripped-down and/or old version, though. I<br />
use and highly recommend <a href="https://github.com/neovim/neovim/">Neovim</a>, but if<br />
that's not available or up to date for your system, make sure you're on Vim 8.<br />
Vim 7.x is pretty old, and missing a lot of the nice things that are in Neovim<br />
and now in Vim 8.</p>
<p>There are graphical versions of Vim &mdash; Gvim, MacVim, GUI wrappers for<br />
Neovim, etc. You can use those if you want, there's nothing wrong with them. I<br />
don't see the point in them personally, because they don't add anything except<br />
some menus and buttons which all do things you can just do in Vim or in the<br />
shell anyway, but some people really like them. Use the thing that makes you<br />
comfortable.</p>
<h2>Other Editors</h2>
<p>You can also get started in some other editor. Every good editor has a Vim<br />
plugin, and I actually recommend starting this way if you're not comfortable<br />
switching all at once. I used Vim plugins in LightTable, Atom, and TextAdept for<br />
a few months before actually making the switch, and it made things a bit easier.<br />
You will hit limits with those plugins, though: most of them don't have any <code>ex</code><br />
command support (all the things that start with <code>:</code>), and some of them (like VS<br />
Code's) are <em>really</em> basic.</p>
<h2>Configuration</h2>
<p>It's really easy to get lost in configuration, for any editor (or any tool, I<br />
guess). Vim is just as bad as the rest. Some people, myself included, spend way<br />
too much time tweaking their configs. I don't recommend starting with someone<br />
else's configs, though. They'll have opinions that don't align with yours, and<br />
their <code>.vimrc</code> will be built for how <em>they</em> do things not how <em>you</em> do. I <em>do</em><br />
recommend cruising GitHub and looking at people's dotfiles for ideas, but don't<br />
go with some preconfigured setup that you don't understand.</p>
<p>I use this <a href="https://github.com/zacanger/z/blob/master/.vimrc">very minimal<br />
vimrc</a> sometimes, when I need<br />
to, and here's my (kinda messy)<br />
<a href="https://github.com/zacanger/z/blob/master/.config/nvim/init.vim">init.vim</a> for<br />
Neovim.</p>
<p>You will need a plugin manager, eventually. I use NeoBundle, which I think is<br />
Neovim-specific. I hear really good things about Vundle for Vim. Pathogen and<br />
Dein are also out there, but I haven't tried either of them.</p>
<h2>Other Stuff</h2>
<p>You might end up on systems that don't have Vim (like in containers). They will<br />
probably have <code>vi</code>, though. A lot of the stuff you're used to doing in Vim might<br />
not work in vi, but some of it will. You should read up a little bit on<br />
<a href="http://wiki.c2.com/?ViEditor">vi</a> just in case. Also read the bit on how to<br />
pronounce it, because people will be confused if you say <code>veye</code>.</p>
<p>Read <a href="https://sanctum.geek.nz/arabesque/vim-koans">this post</a> (and everything<br />
else on that blog). Seriously. Even to an intermediate user, there's a lot of<br />
good stuff to be learned.</p>
<p>Don't get discouraged. It took me a few weeks to get fully comfortable using a<br />
Vim plugin in other editors, and then another few weeks after I switched<br />
full-time to Vim before I felt like I was productive again. It's like learning<br />
any other big new thing (a language, framework, paradigm, whatever): it takes<br />
time. For me (and for all Vim users, I assume), that time investment has<br />
definitely been worth it.</p>
<h2>Continuing Education</h2>
<p>I make an effort to learn and practice one new thing a day (not Vim-specific; a<br />
piece of Clojure's stdlib, Bash trick, whatever). Once you're comfortable using<br />
Vim, I recommend doing the same. For example, take a few minutes to check out<br />
what you can do with <code>c</code> and try to use <code>c</code> more than usual for a few days,<br />
until you reach for it naturally when it makes sense.</p>
<p>There are Vim Golf sites (and a StackExchange thing, I think). These are fun<br />
ways to learn more efficient ways to get stuff done in Vim.</p>
<p>Don't feel pressured to use more advanced features right away. Neat things like<br />
macros, advanced register usage, and fancy regex stuff are all very useful, but<br />
you don't need to know and use everything all at once. When you find yourself<br />
doing something repetitive or annoying, that's a good time to find a better way<br />
to do it.</p>
