      <p>So, I enjoyed <a href="https://medium.com/@steven_ovadia/opening-linux-even-further-13d2d6289ae0">this<br />
post</a><br />
from Steven Ovadia, the fellow who maintains <a href="http://www.mylinuxrig.com/">My Linux<br />
Rig</a> (which, by the way, is a really great blog, and<br />
you should definitely follow it--it's kind of like <a href="https://usesthis.com/">The<br />
Setup</a>, but without all the... ah..<br />
<a href="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/fa/Apple_logo_black.svg">fruit</a>.</p>
<p>I have a couple of things I'd like to add (Steven touched on these, but some<br />
specifics here might help win you over, if you're currently a user of a<br />
non-free OS).</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Youâ€™re technically-inclined, but might not have a technical job. You like to tweak your interfaces, though.</p>

<p>THIS. Is this not a great way to sum up most Windows power users? The sort of<br />
folk who maybe don't <em>hate</em> Windows 8 (I know 10's the big thing these days,<br />
but I haven't even looked at a screenshot yet...) but definitely preferred 7<br />
and have fond memories of XP. People who have, at some point, thought about<br />
using <a href="http://www.litestep.net/">LiteStep</a>, or monitored with<br />
<a href="http://www.samurize.com/modules/news/">Samurize</a> or<br />
<a href="http://rainmeter.net/">Rainmeter</a>, or ever spent some time on<br />
Microsoft-related tags on <a href="http://customize.org">Customize.org</a>, or follow<br />
<a href="http://www.askvg.com/">blogs full of tech tips</a> mostly related to your<br />
operating system. This is about you, and Linux is where you belong. You know<br />
how much trouble it was to get Visual Styles figured out when they changed<br />
that, and then to disable some Aero bits but retain some theme options, and to<br />
get a regular old start menu back in 8? Isn't it frustrating that you have to<br />
actually <a href="http://www.sevenforums.com/tutorials/1911-take-ownership-shortcut.html">install other<br />
software</a><br />
just to be able to delete, modify or even <strong>see</strong> some files on your computer?<br />
Chances are you've spent a good bit of time doing things to improve how<br />
Windows works for you, and that's great. You're definitely not alone;<br />
<a href="http://www.deviantart.com/browse/all/?q=windows+7+themes">DeviantArt is FULL</a><br />
of like-minded people who do some really fantastic stuff with Windows--and<br />
that's just graphical stuff! Getting into heavy system modification is a<br />
really scary thing for a lot of Windows users.</p>
<p>The thing is, there's no 'I REALLY shouldn't do this because Microsoft won't<br />
like it' kind of feeling with Linux. No one's going to automatically install<br />
broken hotfixes if you don't want them. No one's going snooping through your<br />
computer to see if the most basic level of software came with a license<br />
code--and no one's going to lock it down or power it off from a remote<br />
location if you didn't pay them $40 for the OS (note: last time I bought<br />
Windows, it was $40 for Windows 8 64-bit Pro; I have no idea what they charge<br />
these days). If you want to change how things look, it's not just okay, it's<br />
<em>easy</em>. I mean, seriously. <code>sudo su</code> and browse to <code>/usr/share/icons</code>; put<br />
some icons in. Boom. Icons. If you're using a DE (desktop environment), it's<br />
picked them up and you'll see it in your settings. If you're using a WM<br />
(window manager), it may depend on your WM or file browser (but this is<br />
getting a bit complicated--we'll assume you're using a DE for the moment). But<br />
either way, once icons are there, you don't have to manually select them per<br />
item every time you want to change something--or every time you make a visual<br />
change to something <strong>else</strong>. That sounds like an absurdly simplified example,<br />
but it serves as a good illustration of just how difficult basic things can be<br />
on some systems.</p>
<p>One other quick thing, which Windows users may find a bit shocking: we<br />
configure things with plain text. Yeah. <strong>Plain. Text.</strong> No funky weird files<br />
you can't open in any editor known to man and have to install software from<br />
shady people you met in an alley somewhere (shady internet people in a shady<br />
internet alley, anyway) just to be able to read. What's even better is that<br />
plain text can be simpler, faster, and better than Notepad. If you're a<br />
<a href="https://notepad-plus-plus.org/">Notepad++</a> user, props. That's just about the<br />
most useful bit of software I ever installed on Windows 8 (or 7). Take a<br />
gander at all the <a href="https://github.com/amix/vimrc">crazy stuff you can do</a> with<br />
arguably the most popular editor for Linux, <a href="http://github.com/vim/vim">Vim</a>.<br />
Heck, you could just <a href="http://cream.sourceforge.net/download.html">install Vim</a><br />
right now. We won't even get into<br />
<a href="http://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/SiteMap">Emacs</a>... that's like having an<br />
entire extra operating system in your text editor. But back to configuration:<br />
text files. I have, for example, some <a href="https://github.com/zacanger/z">nifty configs of my<br />
own</a> that I keep synced between all my<br />
devices--nothing too fancy, not nearly on the level of <a href="https://github.com/paulirish/dotfiles">some very impressive<br />
collections</a>. Our text files can be<br />
edited with just about anything, including fancy IDEs with plugins and<br />
databases and such, and also including simple commands issued in a terminal<br />
(or console); we store them in uniform, sane places like<br />
<code>/home/yourUserName/.configurationFileForProgram</code> and, for system files (all<br />
users) <code>/etc/program.conf</code> (sometimes that'll be split into multiple files per<br />
program--we just put all those inside a folder and tack a '.d' onto the end of<br />
the name, like <code>/etc/apt/sources.list.d/</code>). There's no rule saying you <em>must</em><br />
configure things with text, and <a href="http://www.xfce.org/">my preferred DE</a> has<br />
<a href="http://docs.xfce.org/xfce/xfce4-settings/start">quite a snazzy tool</a> to make<br />
things more user-friendly. If you give the plain-text option a try, though,<br />
you may find yourself loving it!</p>
<p>Okay, Mac friends. Don't think I've forgotten you. We'll call this post part<br />
one of two; I've been wanting to get myself set up with a decent (and<br />
self-hosted) static site/blog tool, and I think maybe writing actual<br />
decent-length posts is a good enough reason to just sit down and find one I<br />
like. To be continued.</p>
<p>OH, before I forget, you should maybe <a href="https://manning.com/books/learn-linux/in-a-month-of-lunches">check out the book that Steve's<br />
writing</a>; it's<br />
also linked in <a href="https://medium.com/@steven_ovadia/opening-linux-even-further-13d2d6289ae0">the original<br />
post</a><br />
that sparked this bit of blogging.</p>
