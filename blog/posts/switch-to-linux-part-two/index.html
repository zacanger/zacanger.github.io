      <h2>DO IT NOW. NOOOWWW.</h2>
<p>So, Mac friends, what's up? How's it going? All good with you? Good, good I'm<br />
glad. Look. Maybe we should talk.</p>
<p>I know you like your iPro Airpod. And it's very nice, it is. It's shiny and fast<br />
and does things, which are really the top requirements for any computing device,<br />
I think. But is it really what you want to be using? Look, if it is, that's<br />
cool. But have you considered some other options? There's a world outside of<br />
Cupertino. A whole, wide, incredible world of technology that presents broadly<br />
varied experiences that don't all follow Apple's guidelines on everyrhing.</p>
<hr />
<p>For example, your computer, your OS, what it's based on... that's Unix,<br />
actually. BSD-derived--and POSIX/Single Unix Specification certified. <a href="https://opensource.apple.com/source/xnu/">Your<br />
kernel</a> is XNU, which stands for 'X<br />
is Not Unix.' But it totally is, actually. You're closer than you know to<br />
having an open system, but right now you're limited by the Appley-ness of your<br />
Apple. If the idea of installing software that doesn't come from the App Store<br />
or some other official source is alien to you, that's okay. I'm here to tell<br />
you, it's an option. And you don't even need to make a switch all at once.<br />
Since OS X has been POSIX-compliant since Leopard, you can actually get a lot<br />
of sofware that's made for other *nix systems running just fine on your<br />
Macbook. There are some third-party package mangers out there that come highly<br />
recommended (I haven't tried them myself; I haven't owned a Mac since around<br />
OS 8). Among them are <a href="http://www.pkgsrc.org/">pkgsrc</a>,<br />
<a href="http://www.macports.org/">MacPorts</a>, <a href="http://www.macports.org/">Homebrew</a>,<br />
and <a href="http://www.finkproject.org/">Fink</a> (which, as a<br />
<a href="http://debian.org">Debian</a> user, I'd recommend--Fink uses our dpkg/APT<br />
system!).</p>
<p>These things are a start. If you're happy with everything about your system<br />
and options now, there's really no need to change, and you could probably have<br />
stopped reading this after the first sentence. But if you've ever been a<br />
little irked at the limited selection of software available to you, or how<br />
everything on every Mac looks exactly the same, or how little actual control<br />
you have over your interface, Linux might be a good option for you. This goes<br />
for developers as well. I know Macs are big in some development communities,<br />
especially with web folks. From what I understand, Ruby conferences are<br />
indistinguishable from Apple conventions. Javascript hackers are also<br />
especially keen on Macs, though that can cause some issues with Apple Webkit<br />
vs The Rest Of The World, etc. Linux might not have the brand power of Apple,<br />
but we've got compatibility coming out our ears, and we're nearly swimming in<br />
customization options. Instead of, say, <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/linux">using Javascript to install Linux on<br />
your Mac</a>, why not give Linux a try...<br />
for real? <a href="http://ubuntu.org">Ubuntu</a> might be a good starting point for<br />
you--they're big on unified interfaces and styling, over there, and while it's<br />
not Aqua, and they're not too keen on Helvetica (or San Francisco...), it's<br />
just as uniform and integrated-feeling as OS X (and probably a bit more fun).</p>
<p>I'm not going to go all out with this one; I could talk for months about the<br />
reasons folks should consider Linux (or a BSD), and especially about the<br />
reasons NOT to use Apple products, but that's not a topic for here and now. If<br />
you're interested, please do follow me on<br />
<a href="http://twitter.com/zacanger">Twitter</a>; I post notes on various webapps and<br />
always link to them on Twitter, and occassionally go on little rants--just<br />
enough to fill up a page of your feed 8D.</p>
<p>Thanks so much for reading! If you missed it, <a href="https://notes.pinboard.in/u:zacanger/1519026e3458629771c8">here's the first part of this<br />
note</a>, where I talk<br />
about Windows a bit. This was as an addition to <a href="https://medium.com/@steven_ovadia/opening-linux-even-further-13d2d6289ae0">this<br />
post</a><br />
by <a href="http://mylinuxrig.com">this guy</a>, who is writing <a href="https://manning.com/books/learn-linux/in-a-month-of-lunches">this<br />
book</a>; if you're<br />
thinking about trying Linux, it's definitely worth checking that out.</p>
