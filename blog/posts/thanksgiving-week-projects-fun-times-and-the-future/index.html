<p>This week was Thanksgiving. I spent the week holed up at home, working and
studying. I learned Vue (which I love), a bit of Mithril (which was nice), and
did quite a lot of workshopper type of things, and learned a wee bit of Ruby
(which was pretty nice, actually).</p>
<p>I also came across something close to dangerous, here. Goddammit. I hope this
won't be a problem. Actually, I'm pretty sure it won't, because other pepole
are smarter than I am, and better and handling adult relationships. I just...
met a person I'm rather fond of, a while back, and have grown much more fond
of in the past week.</p>
<p>ANYHOW, that's a non-thing, fortunately. NEXT.</p>
