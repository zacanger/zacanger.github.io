<p>I'mma go ahead and deploy this now. I'm doing things the old fashioned way (that is, FTP) because IIS is the worst and it makes me sad. I've decided to stick with bashblog for the moment, only because baker is more than I need. So is bashblog, for that matter, but baker also brings along <a href="http://getbootstrap.com">Bootstrap</a> weight, and that's really not something I can see myself needing in blog context. Mostly I write things in Markdown, sometimes peeking in on them with a nifty live preview script to check things; I don't need widgets and animations and such, here.</p>
<p>Anyhow, I'll now begin the long work of cleaning up all these old posts for self-hosting. Thank goodness.</p>
