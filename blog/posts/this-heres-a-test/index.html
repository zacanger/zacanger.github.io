      <p>Well, all right! This is just a little test. I've tried what may well be five or<br />
six dozen static site/blog generators over the past few months, and I'm back at<br />
two of the ones I tried<br />
first--<a href="https://github.com/cfenollosa/bashblog">Bashblog</a> and<br />
<a href="https://github.com/taylorchu/baker">Baker</a>. They're both written in bash, and<br />
both pretty simple. I dig bashblog's one-file thing, and kind of like the<br />
extreme simplicity of the post-editing format, but it's a little sloppy and<br />
requires some disassembly to actually configure. Baker's quite a bit easier to<br />
work with, and quite a bit more attractive by default, but it's also about three<br />
times the size of bashblog. Both of them seem to have Discus/disquszszs/diskust<br />
really stuck in there, and I'm not actually in the mood to sign up for yet<br />
<em>another</em> social platform, so... we'll have to see about that. OH, and neither<br />
one wants to use an alternate implementation of Markdown. not that I mind,<br />
there's nothing terribly wrong with the original one from <a href="http://daringfireball.net">John<br />
Gruber</a>, but I'd prefer to at least have that option.<br />
There are versions in C and Python that I like (and the C is obviously much<br />
faster), as well as the various Javascript implementations that are all the rage<br />
these days. It'd also be nice to work with some extensions. I'm never sure<br />
what's kosher in the original because I rarely use it, but I'm fairly certain I<br />
can't do tables and syntax hightlighting here.</p>
<p>ANYWAY. This is just a quick first post, as a test. I'll be doing the same in<br />
Baker, and then following up by (gradually) reposting all of my archived blog<br />
posts from other platforms, and saved drafts/notes in my Dropbox.</p>
<p>Cheers!</p>
