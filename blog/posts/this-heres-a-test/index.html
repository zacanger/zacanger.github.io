This is just a little test. I&#x27;ve tried what may well be five or
six dozen static site/blog generators over the past few months, and I&#x27;m back at
two of the ones I tried
first--Bashblog and
Baker. They&#x27;re both written in bash, and
both pretty simple. I dig bashblog&#x27;s one-file thing, and kind of like the
extreme simplicity of the post-editing format, but it&#x27;s a little sloppy and
requires some disassembly to actually configure. Baker&#x27;s quite a bit easier to
work with, and quite a bit more attractive by default, but it&#x27;s also about three
times the size of bashblog. Both of them seem to have Discus/disquszszs/diskust
really stuck in there, and I&#x27;m not actually in the mood to sign up for yet
another social platform, so... we&#x27;ll have to see about that. OH, and neither
one wants to use an alternate implementation of Markdown. not that I mind,
there&#x27;s nothing terribly wrong with the original one from John
Gruber, but I&#x27;d prefer to at least have that option.
There are versions in C and Python that I like (and the C is obviously much
faster), as well as the various Javascript implementations that are all the rage
these days. It&#x27;d also be nice to work with some extensions. I&#x27;m never sure
what&#x27;s kosher in the original because I rarely use it, but I&#x27;m fairly certain I
can&#x27;t do tables and syntax hightlighting here."/><meta name="author" content="Zac Anger"/><meta name="keywords" content="blog,design,javascript,js,music,programming,vim,web development,writing,meta,bashblog,markdown,blogging"/><meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1"/><meta name="twitter:card" content="summary"/><meta name="twitter:site" content="@zacanger"/><meta name="twitter:creator" content="@zacanger"/><meta name="twitter:title" content="This Here&#x27;s A Test!"/><meta name="twitter:description" content="Well, all right!

<p>ANYWAY. This is just a quick first post, as a test. I'll be doing the same in
Baker, and then following up by (gradually) reposting all of my archived blog
posts from other platforms, and saved drafts/notes in my Dropbox.</p>
