<h2 id="three-quick-tips-for-succeeding-at-a-bootcamp">Three Quick Tips for Succeeding at A Bootcamp</h2>
<p>I recently graduated from DevMountain, a 12-week immersive web development
bootcamp with campuses in Provo, Salt Lake, and Dallas. I had an
overwhelmingly positive experience, and I landed a great job soon after
graduation. So for me, the bootcamp was a good choice. I've noticed this
disparity, though, between people who attend bootcamps and have a positive
experience, and people who have a negative one. Oftentimes this negativity is
caused by inability to find a job after finishing up a bootcamp.</p>
<p>Here are three tips to help you end up in the column of success stories.</p>
<h3 id="enjoy-what-you-do">Enjoy What You Do</h3>
<p>Perhaps this sounds obvious, but I was surprised about how many people signed
up to go to a bootcamp without having any idea of whether or not they liked
programming. Some people are lured in by the prospects of landing a shiny new
job, and I get that. It's a tempting idea. But, if you don't enjoy what you're
doing, it's going to be very hard to succeed. Even if you can get through the
bootcamp and land a job, why would you want to start a career doing something
you don't enjoy? I spent several months teaching myself to code before going
to the bootcamp, so by the time the first day of class came around, I already
had a healthy enjoyment for programming.</p>
<h3 id="set-yourself-apart">Set Yourself Apart</h3>
<p>In a nutshell, the way I landed my job was by learning and doing something
that almost nobody in my cohort did. I learned ReactJS, which was not taught
heavily as curriculum at the time I attended DevMountain. Really diving into
React on my own enabled me to contribute to some open source components at MX
(a startup in Utah). When I applied for the apprenticeship at MX, they
received a slew of other talented applicants, but I was able to land the job.
This was largely due to the fact that they had a rapport with me via
back-and-forth communication in pull requests, and my open source
contributions gave them confidence I could contribute to their codebase. There
are a lot of ways to set yourself apart - learn something different, build
something different, contribute to open source, etc. Find something that
interests you and dive in.</p>
<h3 id="make-connections">Make Connections</h3>
<p>I prefer the phrase make-connections over 'network'. I hate the idea of
business-type-people mingling over cocktails and that's what I used to think
of when I heard the word network. What I've found though, is making
connections doesn't have to be uncomfortable. Twitter can be an extremely
useful tool for chatting with prominent developers in your area, and you can
also ask them an occasional question. So not only can you make connections and
form relationships, but also you can get some help from experts in the field.
Forming relationships on twitter enabled me to speak at my first meetup.</p>
<p>Twitter isn't the only way to have success with this. I've connected with
people over linkedin and in person as well. Find what works for you. One last
tip on this - it's a lot easier to network when you <em>aren't</em> desperate for a
job. When you reach out to someone while you're looking for a job, no matter
how well your intentions are, it might come across like you're looking for a
handout. I addressed this by networking very early in the bootcamp, so the
pressure of finding a job was lifted.</p>
<p>This isn't a ground breaking list of tips, but I was surprised to see people
who failed to do one or multiple of these things. Give it a go, and I wish you
the best of luck in your new journey as a developer!</p>
