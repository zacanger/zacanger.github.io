<h2>Frames</h2>
<p>Tone and voice is an abstract concept; talking about it mostly hits the
superficial level, the <em>how</em> of things. Framing is more integral to the message
in that it is the actual message itself. When you convey information, there's a
certain frame attached to it. What is the goal you're trying to achieve with
the information you're sending; what is the feeling you're trying to invoke?
Framing is staple to language, and recognizing the frame someone is using can
lead to a sharper understanding of someone's message.</p>
