      <p>(copy-pasted from a mastodon thread.)</p>
<p>i've seen this meme going around a bit that compares unix-y systems/linux<br />
distros and categorizes them in terms of something like "actual sysadmin" to<br />
"windows user" and i just wanna say, don't take it seriously.</p>
<p>i've been using 95%-ish free software for about 10 years now, including linux<br />
on the desktop. my job is mostly working with linux stuff, including all the<br />
hip, modern ops stuff (like containers and kubernetes and shit).</p>
<p>on my own computers, i've run debian, arch, ubuntu, elementary, freebsd (very<br />
briefly), opensuse (also briefly), fedora, and lots of other debian and arch<br />
derivatives. i am, like, sort of a professional at this stuff, since i get<br />
paid lots of money to do it, as a living.</p>
<p>right now, i have five laptops. one is a mac, one runs windows 10, one has<br />
debian sid, one has manjaro, and one has peppermint (i am not joking,<br />
peppermint is slick). i do linux and servers and shit <em>for a job</em> and i run<br />
the distros that the meme says is for babies.</p>
<p>there's nothing wrong with using shit that just works. i use windows on one<br />
laptop because audio software (vsts, the DAW i like) just works. i have a mac<br />
because it Just Works with Meraki and AD and whatnot. i use boring, "babby"<br />
distros on my personal laptops because i spend a lot less time memorizing tar<br />
flags and compiling openssl when pacman shits itself.</p>
<p>as a certified professional person who does computers for a living, i'm<br />
telling you, you don't need to use netbsd or gentoo to be good at computers.<br />
and tbh i'd argue that if you're using gentoo at work, you're wasting your<br />
time and your employers money, and you should just use something that works.<br />
(nothing against gentoo, i've never actually run gentoo, i'm sure it's swell.)</p>
<p>i've been thinking a lot lately about Not Invented Here syndrome and too much<br />
abstraction and always doing the cool thing rather than the thing that makes<br />
sense, so this stuff is on my mind. i should not be spending time debugging an<br />
in-house hacky feature flag system when we could just use a thing that's<br />
already well-supported. and no one should run their own kubernetes, you should<br />
just use the thing your cloud provider already has (or rancher).</p>
<p>and you should not be hunting down your own drivers and trying to figure out<br />
how to get a working version of glibc on your super hip unix software<br />
distribution.</p>
<p>unless that's something you're really into! if you are, that's cool, and you<br />
should totally do that!</p>
<p>but if that's not why you're using linux or bsd, then fuck that, find<br />
something stable and usable! i like watching kdramas on viki! i don't like<br />
trying to figure out how to use curl without a libc!</p>
<p>anyway, there's a sunday rant for you. TLDR: use shit that works if you have<br />
better things to do. if you have good reasons to use shit that needs help to<br />
get it working (including just for fun!), then do that. but don't feel like a<br />
noob if you use shit that just works. i use shit that just works. people will<br />
pay you money if you know how to use shit that just works.</p>
<p>i'm also definitely not saying we should all use the same boring, stable stuff<br />
all the time. if you're a person who hacks on really fun, low level stuff,<br />
that's awesome! people working on wayland, for example: that's awesome! the<br />
rest of us need you!</p>
<p>but if you're a person trying to just use linux on the desktop, or trying to<br />
maintain a whole bunch of servers, or whatever, just use the boring thing! use<br />
the boring thing until the hipster thing is the boring thing! that's okay!</p>
<p>it's easy to argue that the exciting new stuff won't become stable and boring<br />
unless we all adopt it and contribute back, and i guess there's some validity<br />
to that, but at the same time, i need to watch my korean soap operas, and i<br />
definitely DON'T need to try to explain to the CTO that i put some hipster<br />
distro in production because i thought we should be supporting experimental<br />
stuff and that's why we lost a million dollars yesterday.</p>
<p>it's OKAY to use boring stuff, because boring stuff works.</p>
