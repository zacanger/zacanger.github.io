      <p>One thing that bugs me, as a person who does computers for a living, is that<br />
people who do computers for a living suck at sharing our progress with the rest<br />
of the world.</p>
<p>If writers, musicians, visual artists, bloggers, even people we work with like<br />
marketing folks and UX designers, had any idea how cool the tools are that we’ve<br />
built for ourselves, we could have a thousand new amazing businesses to build.</p>
<p>In the writing space alone, we could build tools based on vim, pandoc, alex,<br />
git, rsync, latex, and probably more that i’m not thinking of.</p>
<p>I know Abstract exists and that's awesome, but it's only one very narrow,<br />
specific problem. Why aren't we solving other problems that way? We have cool<br />
shiny stuff and it works really well, mostly. And people are emailing themselves<br />
drafts so they don't lose their work if their computer dies, like it's 1995. Why<br />
don't we build more cool stuff for other people who create cool stuff?</p>
<p>I want to help people make cool stuff, and it pisses me off that the best advice<br />
folks can offer people is "learn git and get bitbucket because you get free private<br />
repos" and also "stop using microsoft products, you can't diff a docx."</p>
<p>I don't have a point, I'm just annoyed that programmers have all these cool toys<br />
and we haven't done anything useful for anyone else with them, we've just made<br />
our own lives better.</p>
<p>IF YOU HAVE IDEAS let me know. Can we version control audio? Diff images in a<br />
way that makes sense? Give graphic designers the power to make images that are<br />
optimized for different platforms? Let writers check their writing for<br />
insensitive language or easily export pretty PDFs and Word documents? IDK, but I<br />
think it's pretty shitty that we engineers can do all that shit for ourselves<br />
and not find ways to share that with anyone else.</p>
<p>Developers made rsync friendly (dropbox). What if we could do the same with Git?<br />
Imagemagick? Static analysis? I don't know what that would look like, but those<br />
are products I would care about, because they'd be helping people get work done.</p>
<p>Some ideas:</p>
<p>MS Word, but build on pandoc for incredibly easy file conversions, and also Git<br />
for easy change management ('I liked this edit, but not this one'), and an<br />
'advanced mode' which just goes into Vim's normal mode. We could build this!</p>
<p>Figma and Invision are at least partially built in JS, CSS, and in Figma's case<br />
some WASM. Why don't they have really good visual diffing integrated? Why hasn't<br />
anyone build something for this?</p>
<p>Audio files are hard. MIDI is a mess. I don't know what to do here, but to start<br />
with, just using open formats would help. No more VST 2.x crap, no more FLPs,<br />
use something build on plain text that can be parsed by other tools. Free<br />
software DAWs are actually pretty damn good, and have been for ten years or<br />
more.</p>
<p>IDK. We need better tools for people who aren't programmers, and they need a<br />
better business model than MS Word and any fucking Adobe subscription. FOSS with<br />
a paid service (think npm) seems to work pretty ok. If you have any big ideas,<br />
get in touch.</p>
