      <p>Note: This is actually from not-today; whenever wspd was. Also, it's lame. One day I'll speak words about things, I guess.</p>
<hr />
<p>I hear today is <a href="https://www.iasp.info/wspd/index.php">World Suicide Prevention<br />
Day</a>. I'm not going to share my own story,<br />
not the specifics. The past five years have been an extraordinarily difficult<br />
time, and last summer (2014) things went <strong>bad</strong>, and didn't really start to get<br />
better for months. I still haven't talked to anyone about what actually happened<br />
last summer--not other people who've been through the same things, not my<br />
doctor, not the therapists, and certainly not family. At some point I'll have<br />
to, I know, but the thought of putting it into words is terrifying.</p>
<p>But it was a mistake to let it get to me so much that I didn't intend to<br />
survive. I set out on an extremely self-destructive pathd--and this is coming<br />
from someone with a history of addiction, self-sabotage, and recklessness. I<br />
couldn't stand being alive. I did my very best to get out of it. There were<br />
two distinct suicide attempts: one, mixing copious amounts of booze with<br />
barbiturates and opiates, passing out in the middle of the street in my own<br />
vomit; the second, slashing up my arms and, with a feeling of <em>relief</em>,<br />
shooting off a quick Facebook message to a friend who I'd asked to be the<br />
executor of my will, such as it was. I didn't expect to get through either<br />
event, but the good will and love of other people kept me alive. Things were<br />
not good, and I didn't <em>want</em> to be helped; I didn't think there was any other<br />
way to stop the overwhelming pressure, fear, and pain that had become my life.<br />
Well, I was wrong.</p>
<p>My chiefest regret from all of these goings-on isn't the series of mistakes<br />
and bad choices (mixed in with a whole lot of bad luck) that ended up leaving<br />
me feeling that helpless. If I'd managed to do what I attempted, I'd've missed<br />
out on a lot of things I never thought could happen. I'm an uncle, now. And a<br />
semi-professional in a field I actually enjoy. I've learned some skills that<br />
can help diffuse the sense of drowning. There's a way out, and it doesn't mean<br />
taking my own life.</p>
<p>It's not easy. If you're dealing with depression (or any other disease), or a<br />
bad situation at home or work, or a painful or traumatic experience, or an<br />
unhealthy relationship, don't let anyone <em>ever</em> tell you it's not a big deal<br />
or make you feel like less of a person for being overwhelmed by it. These<br />
things aren't easy. Sometimes shit just <em>really fucking sucks,</em> and sometimes<br />
it doesn't get better for a long time. But it does get better. It takes work.<br />
It takes a lot of effort, and time, and maybe medication, and maybe cutting<br />
toxic things out of your life. But it's worth it, and there are people who<br />
will help. To make it through another day becomes a little victory. Looking<br />
back on another month of surviving and working towards being happy, you feel a<br />
sense of accomplishment. It's a major achievement, survival, sometimes, and<br />
it's okay to treat it like one.</p>
<p>Therapy, meds, groups, or even just talking about things aren't for everyone<br />
and every situation, but staying alive and exploring the options for help <em>is</em><br />
for everyone. If the only thing you have control over is your ability to stay<br />
alive, don't give that up. It's your own; you're your own; own yourself, and<br />
don't let anyone take that from you. I'll say again--it's not easy, and anyone<br />
who says it is hasn't been through what you're going through. Living isn't<br />
easy, and living through really tough times is even less easy, but it's worth<br />
trying.</p>
<p>This post is kind of a disorganised mess; there are things I personally still<br />
haven't even tried to deal with, and I'm not sure how to voice how I feel<br />
about the past year of slow, incremental recovery. But I'm glad I'm still<br />
around. If some strangers hadn't called an ambulance and put me in the<br />
hospital that night, and if my dear friend and her boyfriend hadn't made the<br />
drive and bandaged me and demonstrated to me so clearly that there were still<br />
people who are truly good and who love me, I would've missed out on so much. I<br />
owe them more than my life (and they can't have that anyway--it's mine!); I'm<br />
indebted to them for all the joy I've had in the past year, and all that I'll<br />
have for the next several decades.</p>
<p>If you have someone to talk to, give it a shot. I'll bet there's someone in<br />
your life who's struggling through something similar. We're good at hiding<br />
things until it's too late, and pretending we're okay when we're really at the<br />
edge of what we can take. Reaching out could save someone else's life, and<br />
it'll definitely save yours.</p>
