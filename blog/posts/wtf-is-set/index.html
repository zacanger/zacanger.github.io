<pre><code class="language-JavaScript">getNames (contacts) {
  let contacts_set = []

  contacts.forEach((contact) =&gt; {
    let firstName = get(contact, 'contactInfo.firstName')
    let lastName  = get(contact, 'contactInfo.lastName')
    let fullName = `${firstName} ${lastName}`

    if (contacts_set.includes(fullName)) {
      return
    } else {
      contacts_set.push(fullName)
    }

    set(this, 'contactsSet', contactsSet)
  })
}
</code></pre>
<p>Note that the <code>get</code> and <code>set</code> going on here seemed to be Ember-specific. I don't
know Ember so don't ask me.</p>
<p>And I said, how about this?</p>
<pre><code class="language-JavaScript">getNames: (contacts) =&gt;
  [...new Set(
    contacts.map(({ contactInfo: { firstName, lastName }}) =&gt;
      `${firstName} ${lastName}`))]
</code></pre>
<p>I like this version because it's very concise and still readable (to me).
It also doesn't do mutation-y stuff, which is a good thing.</p>
<p>And then someone else asked:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Can some one eli5 what <code>Set</code> is that's referenced above?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Which made me realise that a lot of folks still aren't using a lot of the nice
new things from ES2015, so I explained a bit. Here's how I understand it.</p>
<p>Set is a new (in ES2015) iterable builtin (like Array, String, TypedArray). Map
is also new in 2015. Set is to Array as Map is to Object, kinda.</p>
<p>For practical usage Set is basically Array but unique, and with different
methods. <code>add</code>, <code>has</code>, <code>delete</code>, <code>size</code>, and some others. There's a lot more
info <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Set">on MDN</a>.</p>
<p>You can pass <code>Set</code> an iterable, which is why the thing I have above works
(because thing inside <code>new Set()</code> results in an array).</p>
<p>In that case <code>Set</code> isn't being used for too much besides just the fact that it's
<code>Set</code> (so it only holds unique values). Someone else pointed out in the same
channel that maybe it's not the best idea if you have a lot of values, because
then you're creating another thing, which is totally true.</p>
<p>There's a bit more background
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Set_(mathematics)">here</a> on what JS's <code>Set</code> is
suppose to be kind of like.</p>
<p>And underneath it sorta looks vaguely like this:</p>
<pre><code class="language-JavaScript">class Set {
  constructor () {
    this.storage = []
  }
  add (a) {
    if (!this.storage.includes(a)) {
      this.storage.push(a)
    }
  }
  has (a) {
    return this.storage.includes(a)
  }
  remove (a) {
    this.storage.splice(this.storage.indexOf(a), 1)
  }
}
</code></pre>
<p>That's a lot of stuff, but mostly you can think of <code>Set</code> as a thing that's like
<code>Array</code> but it only holds unique things.</p>
<p>There's also a <code>WeakSet</code> which can only hold objects. I haven't really found a
valid use case for <code>WeakSet</code> and <code>WeakMap</code> yet, personally.</p>
<p><code>Set</code> turns out to be pretty useful. I've used it a few times <a href="https://jane.com">at
work</a> (with appropriate polyfills) without any problems, and I
use it in a few places in <a href="https://github.com/zacanger/zeelib">zeelib</a>, my
sort-of-sometimes-popular utility library. Definitely play around with it!</p>
