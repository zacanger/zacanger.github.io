Pusher

Pusher is a hosted API for WebSockets, with Flash and HTTP fallbacks (in the JS lib). They also have a REST API. It's a simple pub/sub model, with filtering and auth, which allows for private channels and presence functionality. Getting up and moving in JS is pretty simple: include `pusher.js` (`<script src="//js.pusher.com/3.0/pusher.min.js"></script>`), open a connection with `var pusher = new Pusher('API-KEY)`, subscribe with `var channel = pusher.subscribe('channel-name')`. Listening for events:


    channel.bind('event-to-listen-for', function(data){  
      console.log('event was triggered... message: ' + data.message)  
    })  


Using their server lib (for Node):  

    var Pusher = require('pusher')  

    var pusher = new Pusher({  
      appId: 'APP-ID'  
    , key: 'APP-KEY'  
    , secret: 'APP-SECRET'  
    })  

    pusher.trigger('channel-name', 'event-to-listen-for', {'message': 'boing!'})
