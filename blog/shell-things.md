shell things

Just some tidbits.

Renaming all files in `cwd` to have a certain extension:

    for i in *
    do
      mv $i $i.ext
    done

Or with sed: `find . -name "file" | sed 's/.*/mv & &.ext/' | sh`

Or in vi: something like `ls -a file* > a`, then `vi a`, and the command `:%s/.*/mv & &.ext/`, then `ZZ` and `sh a`. (It's the same as the sed command above, just in vi, basically).

Doing the same thing, but with files of a certain extension:

    for i in *.txt
    do
      x=`basename $i .old`
      mv $i $x.ext
    done

Or with sed: `find . -name "*.old" | sed 's/\(.*\.\)\(.*\)mv & \1ext/' | sh`.

Or in vi: `ls -a file* > a`; `vi a`; `:%s/\.old$/\.ext/`; `sh a`.

--------

`:!./%` runs your current file from vi.

This little script is pretty nice. It's a much shorter version of something I modified from soem blog somewhere (check my dotfiles for the full thing, which I called [writescripts](https://github.com/zacanger/z/blob/master/bin/sh/writescripts)):

    if [ ! -f $1 ] ; then
      echo "#!/usr/bin/env bash" > $1
    fi

    while [ 1 ] ;
    do
      $EDITOR $1
      chmod 755 $1
      ./$1
      read dummy
    done

`paste` is _really_ useful, and you should learn it.

that's all, for now, i think.
