This is old, but I just found it lingering in my important docs directory in
Dropbox. So... before I move it away, I figured I'd post it here in case
someone is looking into these things at some point.

FWIW, I'm now officially at DevMountain (day one, yo), and I think I made the
absolute best possible choice here.

# bootcamp/immersive education thoughts and notes and stuff
### version eleventy-million and three, i think. posting here for easy reference.
#### i've ruled out most options, based on the two following sections. i think i've exhausted the research/resource options for this stuff; i can't imagine there's a decent programme in the US that isn't in my browser history by now. it's down to these four.

### Goals: Looking For
* HTML5, CSS required (bonus if they mention modularity of CSS vs CSS2/CSS3 etc)
* JS absolutely required (more job listings than all the rest combined, plus obvs. it's the future of the web, and the web is the future of the desktop, etc etc etc)
* Multiple _modern_ JS frameworks/libraries a plus (/&/ platforms. though it'd be especially useful to get a handle on angular, iojs, components, ember, and maybe meteor.)
* Large focus on _design_ and _interaction/experience_
* As in, code bootcamp, but in the context of design, not just random programming for programming's sake (the mrmrs/jxnblk approach, if that's a thing)
* Must have job placement assistance.
* Less than 10k would be nice, but improbable. Let's say under 15 for tuition, but in a situation/location where housing is feasible.
* Minimum of full-time, plus if _**superhardcore**_ (immersive 60hrs+/week, etc)
* Basic server side training is okay, and possibly a plus, but not if emphasized. Really it'd just be nice to understand the 'M' in MEAN.

### Goals: To Avoid
* ASP/.NET/m$ crap (if it's closed, that means more education needed in 2-5 years when they change the format again)
* MacMania (that includes XCode, Swift, Sketch, etc., or any camp with a website that says _retina_ more than twice)
* Ruby/on Rails (for SO many reasons. see: rails is a ghetto, RoR performance, the millions of articles/posts re: criticism of ruby both as a language and as a culture. also see: people who are obsessed with ruby. they're almost as oddly cult-like as the apple kids. oh, and ruby's the least in-demand web language, as far as jobs are concerned.)
* Places that claim to turn out 'Full Stack Web Designers' (or '...Developers'). It's a nice thought, but there's no such thing as a unicorn (there are maybe a handful of prominent devs who can actually do everything from DBs to IxD, and do it well; but people aren't superhuman. then they'd be superpeople. also, the 'full stack' thing is actually pretty low on the list of recruiter requirements.)
* Places that don't proofread (if you can't spellcheck your website, i'm not sure i'd trust you with my education)
* PHP (while it's something i do need to know because every company ever apparently still uses giant bloated PHP CMSs, it's something i can pick up on my own, and not something i'd put high up on a CV...)
* Any camp that requires membership in other paid services (this includes places that _require_ pre-work through a specific paid vendor and places that require OR only teach with/use a specific proprietary piece of software, eg Photoshop, Sublime Text, etc -- this seems to go along with the mac /&/ ruby fanboyism, though)


## The Camps

### general assembly
* EVERYWHERE
* 12k for web dev, 10 for ux
* great reviews from students
* also from employers
* good job placement
* actually has a ux course.
* _looks really good, especially ux course. kinda pricey, but possible DC option could mean no housing costs (though that's not an ideal location, experience-wise). this is the top choice._

### DevMountain
* provo
* housing included (which is the primary reason it's actually on this shortlist)
* $9k all told
* front-end dev + db (incl. react & angular!)
* not much info on job assistance
* some reviews from students, but not a whole lot out there.
* _looks like a good option financially; not sure about the job placement though. their course looks sound._

### DevLeague
* hawaii
* 10k
* 'tads' payment (4k, then 2k for 3 months each)
* one needs-based scholarship avail (would likely go towards diversity, though)
* simple code challenge (webapp) in application process
* good alumni
* _probably best i could actually make it into, but there's no chance i could pay for this one; plane tickets AND housing in honolulu? only on here still because i might win the lottery or something_

### Dev Bootcamp
* chicago, nyc, sf
* 13-14k
* 9 weeks remote, 9 in person
* split into 'phases' with possible free do-overs based on evaluations
* there's some coding in the application process, which _does_ include ruby
* this place is the original, and their reputation is nearly as good as HR's
* program itself seems equally based on actual web tech people skills
* _iffy. very good reputation, but $$$$$. would need a great loan to make this work_
