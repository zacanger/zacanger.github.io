That's about to start. I'm tired and I can't focus, and I'm losing a very dear
friend to her demons and I can't seem to do anything about it no matter how much
time I spend on the phone, because at some point I need to turn it off and try
to catch up on work. She's going to die, and I'm not going to be there to stop
it, and it wouldn't matter if I was because nothing would stop her except one
specific asshole completely changing everything about himself and being who he
must have, at some point, said he was.

So, that's going on. But on the other hand... Javascript is good. Um.

---------

No really, I'm worried as fuck about this friend, and about the other one. Yes,
that means I have two friends. Actually, three, but the third is probably the
most competent, level-headed, and rational person I know, so I know she can
handle herself, and wouldn't want random people worrying about things that are
none of their damn business anyway.

I have a roommate. He's amusing. Very chipper, very eager, very Colombian, and
very (very, very, very) aroused, all the time, apparently. I don't think he's
gone ten minutes without talking about sex so far since I've met him. It's not a
horrible thing, but it gets grating. I'm sure there are valid reasons for it
(besides youth, that is), and I'm sure it'll cool down after a while.

The first week at school was interesting, for sure. I'm a mile ahead of anyone
(as far as I could tell) when it comes to command-line stuff, environment
setup, using source control, etc.; in the first ten in the group, probably,
with HTML and CSS, though only because I've done these things before (and
recently, to boot)... JS, not so much, though I think I'm firmly in the top
third, or so. Not wasting time trying to learn the basics of terminal
navigation and initialising a git repo gave me a _slight_ headstart. If I can
manage to focus and pay attention and not get distracted for once in my life,
I can maybe hold on to that.

Okay, anyway. Here's a blog post.

Fuck, I don't know what to do about J. If things end up as poorly as they're
threatening, someone will die, and I care about that someone quite a lot.
Fuck. I can't get anything done, and other people and human emotions are the
reason why.
