drop off

no body; no mind  
no master; no student  
no teachings; no knowledge  
no me; no you  

only rain over the stream  
only hot wind across the sand  
only chill through the trees  
only snow on the mountain  

if you already know  
you don't need to be told  
if you don't know  
telling you won't do any good

### A note on context, added later

Written after around four months of especially heavy study and practice. I had
just spent a couple weeks week experimenting with Vajrayana practices with no
luck, and had decided to return to what I knew. The next day (the date on this
post) I decided to read the Shōbōgenzō, to find out more about Chan. I was just
in the first discourse when things blinked. The experience didn't last for even
a second, or maybe it did, but it was timeless. It wasn't flashy or explosive
like the things I experienced when doing kasina practice, but instead felt like
everything shifted. After, I got up and scribbled most of the poem above. Later
that day I rearranged it a bit, and that night I added the last stanza. I
haven't had this experience confirmed by a teacher, but right now it doesn't
feel like I need to; things aren't the same as they were before.
