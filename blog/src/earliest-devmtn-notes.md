i don't know what
idk

```
vertical organization is by feature;
routes, configs, etc. under the same directory.
this is the devmtn preferred method.
this works for angular as well.
keeps app.js, config (routes), index.html in root --
directives, features, services, & shared (assets), (~~somethingican'tread~~).
starting with webpack and angular2, we'll be moving to `require`s.
heroku will (~~something~~) with last good git commits -- and/or github pushes
```
