I really hate being sick. I turn into a whiny annoying bitching asshole. And
this time I'm even more of all of those things because it was one specific
person (guess who) who got us sick (us being the rest of the apartment).
Gddamn I just hate being sick. I slept for 18 hours, and missed basically two
days of school, and he things it's amusing....
