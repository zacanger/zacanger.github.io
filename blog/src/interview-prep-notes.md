What are interviewers looking for?

* competence (which is screwed, because of non-technical interviewers, and whiteboards)
* passion/interest (how do you keep up with all this stuff, anyway?)
    * the blogs and meetups and whatnots i enjoy
    * linkedin matters, i guess... still, not as much as twitter
        * friend-of-friend is the way to get jobs, not friend, nor ads, etc.
    * presenting at meetups
* creativity
* for dress code, just ask/find out how they are, and how they expect you to be
    * suit and tie? probably not.
        * this means i'm screwed? dammit, gotta not enjoy clothes for two minutes, i guess.
* answer questions in a middle-of-the-road kind of way
    * don't appear totally non-confrontational
    * _or_ totally confrontational
    * basically, be a reasonable human being
* be aware of nervous affectations
    * y'know, uhm, so, weelll, etc.
    * that thing where i look to the left over someone's head when i don't know how to answer a question
* intentional pauses to appear more thoughtful about questions
* be mindful of speed (speaking)
* if in a situation involving strict constraints, put that out there
    * right up front, especially with scheduling things
* during whiteboarding, talk through the whole thing
    * don't just do it silently
    * even if it's a partial solution, having talked through your thoughts would be a big help
    * always assume it'll take 3x the amount of code we think it'll take, so write clearly, but leave a lot of space
    * data-structure problems: objects are hashes
