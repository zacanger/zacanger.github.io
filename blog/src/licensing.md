I just wanted to take a moment to say that I don't actually care even the
slightest bit if someone is offended by some things that I might say, especially
if those things are as basic and trivial as the word 'fuck.' This was brought up
recently, because my [error page](http://zacanger.com/whateverrandomblablahblah)
happens to be 'rude' and 'unprofessional.' (_Note: I agree. It's very
unprofessional to use Internet Explorer, and to interrupt someone at work to
criticize something on their website completely unrelated to any client project
and ask them to remove it. Also, it's not a very nice error page._)

---------

Look, I really don't care. _Fuck_ isn't a particularly nasty word. It's not a
slur, it's not demeaning, it's not a word used specifically to marginalize or
hurt any individual people or groups thereof. So fuck you.

This relates to licenses only in that I usually opt for the
[WTFPL](http://wtfpl.net) over other free licenses. Maybe it's kind of
offensive to some, but there's actually a valid reason for that. Following is
the full text of the license.

    DO WHAT THE FUCK YOU WANT TO PUBLIC LICENSE

    Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim or modified

    0. You just DO WHAT THE FUCK YOU WANT TO.


And here's a paragraph from the [FAQ](http://www.wtfpl.net/faq/):

>**But profanity is offensive!**
>
>You know what? Fuck your stance on profanity. Fuck your priorities in life.
>The WTFPL is about fucking freedom and we mean it. Freedom means freedom to
>copy and modify and share works of art and science with the rest of mankind,
>but also freedom to be gay and marry and have crazy gay sex, freedom to have
>tattoos, freedom to say there is no God, freedom to take the pill, freedom
>to have an abortion. People die for being gay or atheists. Don’t tell me that
>there is something sacred enough that it must be protected from the mere
>existence of the word “fuck”. If the F in WTFPL offends you, then fuck you
>and your beliefs.
>Triple fuck you.

So... that's pretty clear now, yes?
