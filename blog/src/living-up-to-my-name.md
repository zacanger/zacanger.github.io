i don't like being angry. at all. it's not a good look for me. somehow this
weekend turned into one just full of anger about a lot of things. some of them
aren't a big deal, and i can (eventually) just let everything go, because
honestly it's just not worth feeling that shitty about. people aren't worth it,
losing friends isn't worth it, losing time and even wasting or losing money...
it's just never worth being angry about, because it's not going to change
anything, get me back any time or money, fix relationships, or ever somehow make
anything better. this is a little different, though, today. bias against persons
with mental illness of any type (especially something as common and relatively
safe and understood as depression) is _not_ okay, especially when that results
in the wrong people going to fucking _jail_.

--------

i'm not going to go into a huge amount of detail right now, because it'll be a
much better use of my time to start digging into legal documents and trying to
help build up a case for my friend, but to quickly outline the facts of what
happened:

* a friend was pressured into a bad situation that involved alcohol, underage people and under-21 people, her (older) sister, and people just trying to get it in.
* this friend was sexually assaulted recently, and has severe ptsd, so much so that even the idea of people having sex is triggering.
* friend can't really drink much, always gets sick. friend ended up in someone's bathtub, very sick, missing some clothes, for hours, alone for a lot of it.
* people fucking in the next room, so she couldn't leave, and had to sit there and endure the sounds.
* friend finally able to leave, found clothes, was denied her shoes by sister & sister's companions.
* sister & sister's friend, to protect the person supplying alcohol, attacked my friend. this included
    * throttling until nearly passed out
    * severe blows to head in attempt to render unconscious
    * conversation between the sister and the sister's friend regarding what to do with the body, if dead
    * decision to throw the body into nearby pond
    * on realising she was still alive, physically trying to drag back to the house where all this started
* witnesses called police while sister and sister's friend were walking away, having given up the physical labour, intending to return shortly
* police initially seemed sympathetic, but no medics called
* police questioned sister, who stated (falsely) that friend is schizophrenic, inflicted own head wounds after locking self in the bathroom, and that she (the sister) and her friend were trying to 'help her' back
* sister also stated (falsely) that she had been struck first
* friend ended up in jail. some three or four hours later, finally was taken to the ER

now, as far as i can tell, there are a few major things that need to be addressed. one, the pig went with the sister's story, because clearly anyone who needs medication is automatically at fault. two, the stand your ground or whatever bullshit makes it possible for someone with literally no evidence of having been attacked or even touched to attempt murder and get away with it. and three, a person with signs of abuse all over her body, no shoes (in december), bad enough trauma to the head and face that she's unable to go out in public, and no signs of mental illness, was denied medical treatment for hours.

i am _**livid**_. you don't touch my friends. you don't hurt my friends. you definitely don't try to kill my friends and then get them jailed because you don't want your party to end.

it's going to take a while to figure out what i can really do to help, but step one was just jotting down those facts so i don't forget anything.
