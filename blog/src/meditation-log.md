# Meditation Log

This will be a continually-updated document, rather than a series of separate
posts, presented in reverse-chronological order. Since I usually meditate at
night, entries will generally be written the next day.

## 2020-12-22

Last night I had a false start trying to get into fire kasina meditation, got
up for a bit, then settled down into it. I was able hold onto the nimitta for
longer each cycle, but got into the murk and had trouble expanding attention.
I kept at it anyway for a bit, then went to bed holding onto the mantra I'd
been using in the background (I've been attracted to the Heart Sutra mantra
recently, so it was that one), and kept my attention also on the vague
purple/green/white swirls of the murk.

While watching the murk a bunch of strange visuals came up. I don't know how
suggestible this stuff is, but it definitely sounded like bhaya-nana (fear)
from some of the descriptions I've read. I distinctly remember some sort of
warrior-like figures out of a fantasy movie, specifically helmets/masks and
armor that reminded me of the witch-king of Angmar's costume in the LOTR
films. Also an odd effect that was like a thin sliver of a flashlight (like if
you hold your hand over the light and part your fingers a bit) passing over
some faces, one that was a full-face mask, one that was rotting, one that had
blood running across it. Also some visuals of bugs, some crabs or crab-like
things, and other generally kind of creepy stuff. The weird thing was, I can't
really stand bugs, but none of that freaked me out, maybe because I was still
holding on to the mantra and just watching this stuff pop up and then
disappear into the murk. Eventually I did fall asleep.

I'm not sure how this is related, but about 30 or 40 minutes after I went to
sleep, I had a huge shock of energy through my core and bolted upright.
I was shaking, but it felt like everything else (reality) was shaking. At
first I thought there was an earthquake, and I shot off a quick prayer to
Avaloketisvara that it wasn't "The Big One," but then I looked at my water
bottle, and it wasn't shaking, then got up and looked at other objects, and
they weren't shaking. I wasn't shaking either, my hands and limbs seemed
steady, so it was just my perception of everything. I don't know where that
came from but it was intense and disconcerting. I went back to bed holding
onto a simpler mantra (om mani padme hum).

Something else that's probably worth mentioning is that when I use a mantra as
the only object or primary object (but not when I'm using it to augment
something else, so far), it sort of expands on itself, especially if I set
into it somewhat melodically instead of just reciting it. For example with "Om
Mani Padme Hum", if I keep it at one note, eventually a slight harmony will be
added a fourth above, and then that one tries to creep up to a flat fifth and
then a fifth. If I start the Heart Sutra mantra, eventually it takes on a
melody of its own that I didn't consciously indent for it, and then that seems
to double and triple like multiple voices singing in unison. Possibly related,
the soft nimitta (whether it's the "murk" from kasina practice or the nimitta
that appears when doing non-visualization-based practice), has started to
pulse in recent weeks, starting synchronized with the breath but then shifting
a bit so the pulses are coming before or after the breath, and sometimes much
faster than the breath (like it's trying to sync with my heartbeat instead,
maybe). All of this seems to be expected according to what I've read so I'm
not concerned about it, it's just interesting.

Decided to really try fire kasina practice last night not give up on it. I
went at it for 25 minutes, took a break for a couple minutes, then another 20
minutes. After the first two or three cycles (stare at the flame in one spot
for around 30-60 seconds, close eyes, focus on what happens) it got
interesting. The little dot would be reddish, surrounded by a soft pale blue
circle, and then the dot would vanish taking the aura with it, then come back
much more stable and red, then sometimes a little bit of yellowish white would
appear in the middle and the whole thing would spin. MCTB describes that as
having a gold star in the center, but to me it looked more like a laser
pointer dot that got slightly deeper red and larger, shaped like a stylised
flower outline filled with yellowish white. The dot didn't like to stay in one
spot, and would usually drift off to the upper right, but I could move it
around by moving my head from side to side, the dot would follow a second or
two later. I could also put my right hand up like some kind of mudra, in front
of my face, and it seemed to work as a barrier than the dot didn't want to
pass through when it was moving around. That's about as far as I got, but it
seems promising.

My weekend practice is usually lacking, due I think mostly to my neighbors'
loud music. I've started reading the Vimuttimagga while I wait for it to quiet
down, and as a theoretical warm-up to the Visuddhimagga, which I'd like to get
through sometime this coming year. Of course, the most important thing is
actually doing the work, not just reading about it. Maybe some
industrial-grade earplugs would help.

Something else that's been happening on and off in the past week or two is
seeing other random visualizations. These aren't something I'm intending to
see, but I think mantra practice combined with trying to examine the nimitta
does something a little weird. I'll usually see things that remind me of the
style of Chinese or maybe Korean paintings of dragons, tigers, etc., from
maybe the 15th-18th century or so; not that I'm seeing dragons or tigers
specifically, but beings that look like they could've popped out of one of
those paintings, and usually only for a few moments.

## 2020-12-18

Last night I got started late due to work, so was worried I wouldn't have
time before needing to get to sleep. I tried to maintain mindfulness during
everyday activities (washing, washing; brushing, brushing; left foot, right
foot, left foot, turning, turning). Before bed, I sat doing concentration
practice with the prajnaparamita mantra (gate gate paragate parasamgate bodhi
svaha), initially in sync with the breath but then diverging. After around 40
minutes, the discomfort in my knees and hips was becoming hard to ignore, and
since I had resolved to stick to samatha practices, rather than try to
examine the pain I decided to recline, and I also switched to a simpler
mantra (buddho). About ten minutes into this, the mantra sort of faded into
the background, replaced by some common early visuals (white swirling light
type stuff). I focused on that a bit more, and suddenly had a shallow mental
image of spinning lights, like a carousel without horses or riders and with
long tassels of Christmas lights along and slung out from its ceiling, in
bright colors. That shallow mental thought almost immediately solidified into
a concrete visualization which seemed extremely real (I was fully aware that
it wasn't truly there, but it had depth and seemed to really be there). My
eyes were still closed, but I could clearly see it spinning along where my
wall and ceiling met. A deep sense of happiness and something like awe struck
me, I felt it heavily in my chest. The whole experience lasted for probably
less than a second, but it was extremely intense. Afterwards, I at first
tried to cling to it for a breath or two, but then realized that was the
point; it was over and I needed to understand that it was never going to be
permanent. I went back to focusing on the mantra (buddho) for another ten or
fifteen minutes before going to sleep.

Last night I had very little luck, but the night before a strange
visualization happened. Out of the fuzzy/swirly black and white field, in the
bottom right corner, I clearly saw some sort of black-clothed figure. The
clothing was like something out of a fantasy movie, a wispy robe with long
trailers or tatters that were blowing in all directions and pushing into or
overlapping part of the mostly white field behind my eyelids. This was after
a good amount of time doing mantra practice. No idea what it means except
maybe that my ability to concentrate is improving.

I don't think there's much value in adding entries to this log unless
something notable happened, so I'll be skipping days here.

The past couple of days have been extraordinarily stressful, and that will
probably continue for at least the next few weeks. I'm finding that eyes-open
meditation in daily life can help somewhat. Mantra meditation, even for 3-5
minutes if done sincerely, seems to slow everything down and chill everything
out.

Since I usually meditate before going to sleep, most of the entries here will
probably be written the next day about the previous night. I attempted to
reproduce the experience from the 12th (or 10th or 11th, not sure of the
exact date). I didn't set a firm resolution when I got started, so I bounced
between different mantras and the breath for a few minutes, but eventually
stabilized on "bu-dho" again, while reclining. After maybe five minutes, I
was able to interact with the nimitta in interesting ways. I could move it
around with my will, though it didn't always respond exactly the way I
thought it would, and not always immediately. I also tried using my hands to
move it and shape it, with similar results. I could vaguely make out the
shape of my hands (my eyes were closed and this was in a dark room, so it was
a mental image), and they were definitely larger than usual, and seemed to be
made out of some sort of darkness (not in a creepy way, just in a way that
contrasted with the nimitta). I could squeeze, shape, poke, and swirl around
the light in this way. I don't know if this had any value, but it was an
interesting experience. I tried to use this to jump into insight practice by
trying to notice aspects of the three characteristics, but then my
concentration fell apart and it ended. I think I'm pretty weak on both the
concentration and insight sides of practice, but making some progress.

Some background since I started the log late: I started meditating more over
last winter, but didn't really make it anywhere until spring or maybe early
summer 2020. I'd used some basic sort of mindfulness practice years ago in
therapy, but got back into the idea after reading "Why Buddhism Is True". I
also read some of the major Mahayana and Theravada sutras, then MCTB1, TMI,
and then MCTB2, all of which made a big impact. I've attended (online) sangha
on and off (a Plum Village one mostly), and have tried out techniques from
various traditions. After trying noting practice for a while, and also trying
to find the beginnings and ends of breaths as emphasized in parts of TMI, I
realized there was something to this stuff. Basically, when they say "if you
follow these instructions you will get these results", they mean it. So I'm a
believer now. All of the map theory in MCTB is very interesting to me, and I
think, using the main maps Dr. Ingram presents there, it would be reasonable
to say that I had an A&P event when I was 14 (in a Christian context), and
spent the following 15 years or so dealing with the Dark Night. That lines up
too well with my experience to completely discount it, anyway. So now my
focus is on moving past that, but also in learning and experimenting with
these different techniques. Kasina meditation sounds very handy, so I think
I'll want to read the Visuddhimagga and Vimuttimagga sometime soon, too. I
don't know enough, doctrinally, to say I absolutely belong with one specific
tradition or lineage, but Theravada techniques seem to work for me, but I
also like some of the aspects of Chan/Thien/Zen, and am starting to
appreciate the Vajrayana. Maybe I'm en Ekayana Buddhist, if there is such a
thing.

Not sure of the exact date, could be the 10th or 11th too. This comes a few
days after taking the bodhisattva vows (on the 5th). These days were
high-tension. I had been having trouble solidifying the breath as an object.
This night, I tried mantra instead — initially the prajnaparamita mantra from
the heart sutra, I think, but then I switched to just "bu-dho" with the in
and out breath. After maybe 3 or 4 minutes of this, things had become really
thick and syrupy, like my perception was muffled but in a pleasant way, but
it also took some effort to clearly mentally "hear" the mantra. But then as
soon as I noticed that muffled/thick quality, it was like that warm
yellow-brown thickness got cleaned out in an instant, and everything was
clear. I could hear "bu-dho" clearly but didn't feel like I needed to focus
on it as much, and mentally there was a feeling of crispness, like the brown
and yellow had been replaced with a cool blueish white and deep black. That
change startled me enough that I wasn't able to stay in it, though. I don't
know if this was just making it into the first jhana, or mind and body (I
wasn't really doing anything like noting practice so I assume not), but it
felt like progress, so I hope I can do it again.
