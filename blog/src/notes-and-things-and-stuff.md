I'll need to edit this script a bit more. Needing to delete all the filler text
isn't a HUGE deal... if you use a real editor. I mean. It's not a huge deal now,
but nano's not exactly... powerful. I could actually just `^^` start a mark, and
then get to where I need to be, and `^k` cut it... it's the getting aroudn that
doesn't work so well. Home and end work sort of as expected, but `^Space^` and
`M-Space` to go forward/back one word? No, thank you.

Okay, I just wanted to make a note, basically, that I should get http://zcn.gr
at some point. Also, in sticking my head back into the whole freelance project
today, I remembered why I don't much like Bootstrap. It's not that it doesn't
work, because it does, and it works **very** well, if you use it exactly as
intended or have a large enough project to actually need something that
complex and... uh... large. But otherwise it's like using a CMS to run a
(small, personal) blog. Why do it? It isn't a big project, and I know it
would've been ten times easier to just do it from scratch from the start, but
at this point I'm sticking with BS3 because I need to be able to hand the
whole thing over to someone else all documented and sort of making sense--and
they're going to have lovely task of trying to hunt down, obtain, and beautify
some sort of actual content for this thing. (Or, y'know, maybe they'll just
not touch it for another ten years and leave up the sort-of-filler with which
I'll have to deliver it).

It's not all bad, though. I've learned more on this than I thought I would,
specifically in the dealing-with-other-humans area. Mostly, actually, that I'm
not very good at it, and that if given a certain amount of leeway, people will
take every last second right up until an unbendable deadline to start actually
paying attention. (That includes myself; I'm leaving for school in a week, and
I'm fairly certain _I don't know enough Javascript to do things, like, really
at all_.)

I suppose I ought to do something about this thing that I've been doing lately
where I don't sleep, or sleep maybe four hours a night during the week and
then crash for 16 hours on a weekend night/day. That's not healthy, I think.
Hmm.
