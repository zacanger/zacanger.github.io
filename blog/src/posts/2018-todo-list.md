New Year's Resolutions for 2018! Post-dated to the end of the year so I can
check things off as I go and keep reminding myself to keep up with stuff.

A few things are leftovers from [last
year](http://zacanger.com/blog/posts/new-years-resolutions/).

* [ ] Learn about generative art, and make things. It would be especially cool
  to be able to generate based on music.
* [ ] Get familiar enough with Clojure/ClojureScript to write something real-world
* [ ] Same, with Haskell/Purescript
* [ ] Finish the acoustic album
* [ ] Finish the electro tunes
* [x] Eat healthier, cook more for myself, and order less
* [ ] Shop less
* [x] Exercise more
* [ ] Finish more side projects
* [ ] Get out of the house more
* [ ] Get down to 0 nic (vaping)
* [ ] Continue improving my Korean to the point where I can hold conversations
* [ ] Be better at owning my own data
  * [ ] Maybe maintain my own bookmarks (move off of Pinboard)
  * [ ] Use the work Mac only for work
  * [ ] Switch to a more free mobile OS
  * [ ] Remove accounts on shitty services, maybe
* [x] Drink less Utah beer (Utah beer is watered down, but still all the
  calories)
