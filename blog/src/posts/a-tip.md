I have, like, an actual kind of tip, for new-ish developers.

It's pretty simple. Shouldn't be too hard to grasp, maybe a little harder to
implement.

> Have confidence in your code.

If you don't have confidence in your code, then try this:

> Write code in which you have confience.

It really sucks to have to walk someone through your code when you're not
sure it's even doing the things it's supposed to do, or when you _are_ sure
it's doing the right things but doing them in a really gross kind of way.

I think this is something everyone struggles with. It's really easy to copy
and paste stuff from StackOverflow, and everyone does it for a while. I still
do it sometimes, though usually with a lot of testing and reading before
actually running that code.

It's really easy, as a new dev, to say "Well, I don't know how to do that thing,
can you just show me?" And that's okay, but it's a lot more okay to say "Hey,
I spent an hour with the docs, here's my implementation, here's the stack trace
and I couldn't find anything helpful on the source's issues or SO, do you have
any ideas?"

It takes a while to write code that you don't hate, but usually even someone
who's been programming for a few months knows what good code looks like. It's
concise, readable, logical, and consistent. It doesn't make you cringe.

I'm not really very good at writing code and feeling great about it. When it
comes to, say, raw Node or a Bash script, I'm usually better with these things
than anyone I know on a personal level, and have no problem taking charge and
just doing things. But when it comes to the things I actually do every day
(which right now means React, Koa, AWS stuff, Docker, trying to read C#, and
Sass, mostly) I know I'm not that great. Knowing that I'm not that great means
I take probably twice as long as I would to get anything done as I would if I
was the best at that thing in the room, because I know people who know more
than I do will be looking at my code and will need to fix it.

That's not a **bad** thing, but it's not a good thing either. It means I'm
programming without confidence, when I'm writing React or Sass. And I'm not
even _bad_ at either, I just have no confidence when writing these things
on a project with people who are better at them than I am. That's something
that I should get over.

Anyway, I meant to write this post on the train and post it when I got home,
but I ended up standing on the train so it's split, from while waiting for the
train 'til 10:30 PM while sitting at DevMountain, so it's probably a little
disjointed.

The point here is, if you have confidence in what you're doing, you'll get
stuff done quicker and better, and if you don't have confidence in what you're
doing, make it so that you can.
