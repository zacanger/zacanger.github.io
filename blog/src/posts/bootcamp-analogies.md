bootcamps are like a three-month crash-course on building features and creating
value for yourself and your future employer very quickly. and also on learning.
as in, learning to learn stuff on your own.

mentoring at a bootcamp is kind of a three-month course on talking/people
skills. most obviously, there's the explaining code you've never seen before
to people who have no idea what you're saying and might not even speak the
same language (natively).

working at a bootcamp is like being thrown headfirst into both education and
jr dev roles, which can be overwhelming but also awesome.

hanging out at a bootcamp after finishing is like going back to a high school
reunion after going from nerd to hugely successful nerd, waving it in
everyone's face, except everyone is that same nerd so it's kinda more like an
encouraging wave than a "see, told you i'd amount to something" kind of wave.
