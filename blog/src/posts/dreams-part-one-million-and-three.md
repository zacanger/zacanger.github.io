i don't really like dreaming, i think. lately (for the past few months), it's
almost always the same dream that i have. actually it's always a very different
dream, but it's always the same reason for the dream. i don't have a lot of
really serious attachments, but the few i do have, i _really_ don't want to
lose. it scares me, the idea of losing these people, so much so that on the very
rare occassion that i do dream, it's always this.

ugh, i kinda hate dreams.
