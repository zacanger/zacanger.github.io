everyone here is here to learn  

everyone here has something to gain from being here  

i don't understand the idea that it's okay to slack off  
on doing the basic required work, but take up other people's time  
asking questions that, while perfectly valid, are generally answered  
either in said required reading, or within the first five results  
on google.  

i can't keep doing this, because we're now doing things that i actually  
really don't know how to do. losing significant amounts of study time  
to googling things for other people is not an effective way to learn  
anything, i think.

goddammit.
