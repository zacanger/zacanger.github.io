## things i hope to maybe do in 2017

* Work less at work
  * Mainly, stop working on weekends and in the middle of the night and stuff
* Get familiar enough with Racket, ClojureScript, and Haskell to write real-world stuff
* Learn more about `sh` and POSIX compat in general
  * Also convert as much of my dotfiles as possible to use `sh` instead of `bash`
  * Also weed out my dotfiles, they're ridiculous
* At least record the acoustic album that's been written and sitting there for ages
  * Maybe get Windows working enough to finish up the electro album thing
* Be slightly healther, at least
  * Switch to vaping, for real this time
  * Maybe eat better?
    * Less pizza, at least
* Buy a car
* Finish paying off debts, so close
  * Also try not to tap into savings so much for stupid things
* Actually finish anything ever
  * Various unfinished small projects
  * Finish Pharaoh rewrite early on
* Make progress on learning Korean, for real this time
* Try really hard to not write any untested code
* Make a real effort to talk to real humans in real life
* Take the time to move all things using Facebook auth away from this, so I can finally delete my Facebook
* Change how this blog is built, so it's more flexible, and maybe using something fun like Frog
  * Also, blog more (at least, clear out my `drafts` dir).
* Be making more money
  * Preferably where I am now, but somewhere else if that doesn't work out
  * Also start actually emailing recruiters back
* Switch to Mutt or some other purely text-based email client
