These were my NY resolutions for 2017, as a checklist. This post has been
modified several times, mostly just to check things off, but also to rearrange
and edit some items.

## things i hope to maybe do in 2017

* [ ] Get familiar enough with Clojure/ClojureScript to write something real-world
* [ ] Same, with Haskell/Purescript
* [ ] At least record the acoustic album that's been written and sitting there for ages
* [ ] Maybe get Windows working enough to finish up the electro album thing
* [x] Work less at work
  * [x] Mainly, stop working on weekends and in the middle of the night and stuff
* [x] Learn more about `sh` and POSIX compat in general
  * [x] Also convert as much of my dotfiles as possible to use `sh` instead of `bash`
  * [x] Also weed out my dotfiles, they're ridiculous
* [x] Start learning to play the cello
* [x] Be healther
  * [x] Switch to vaping, for real this time
  * [x] Maybe eat better?
    * [x] Less pizza, at least
* [x] Finish paying off debts, so close
  * [x] Also try not to tap into savings so much for stupid things
* [x] Change how this blog is built, so it's more flexible, and maybe using something fun like Frog (using GFM).
  * [x] Also, blog more (at least, clear out my `drafts` dir).
* [x] Be making more money
  * [x] Preferably where I am now, but somewhere else if that doesn't work out
  * [x] Also start actually emailing recruiters back
* [x] Actually finish anything ever
  * [x] Various unfinished small projects
* [x] Make progress on learning Korean, for real this time
* [x] Try really hard to not write any untested code
* [x] Make a real effort to talk to real humans in real life
* [x] Take the time to move all things using Facebook auth away from this
* [x] Delete Facebook
* [x] Get more tattoos
