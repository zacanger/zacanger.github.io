So, I have a _lot_ of notes that I've taken over the course of the last couple
of months. Seeing as they're not doing me a whole lot of good sitting in a pile
of Markdown files, I'm gradually going through them, cleaning them up, and I
think I'll just post them all as sort of blog posts. Why not? So here's a little
list of the topics I'll be covering over the next few weeks:

* Unicode
* SystemJS (and JSPM)
* Go
* UI
* Github Organizations
* Functional Reactive Programming (and RxJS)
* Elm
* Browserify
* Bash Builtins
* Firebase
* ES6
* Pusher
* Styleguides
* Passport (and problems getting errors out of Express)
* React (and Webpack)
* Isomorphic React
* Flux
* Meteor
* All the reasons I kind of dislike Angular
* Bacon.js
* Basics of webmastering (which is totally not a word)
* Functional programming (in general)
* Effective web design
* Mongo (and Mongoose, and MongoJS, and Mongolayer)
* Ruby, maybe a little bit
* Electron (formerly Atom Shell)
* NW.js (formerly Node Webkit)
* Gulp
* Node in general
* Probably a good bit of Node stuff, really
* I like Node a lot
* Maybe a little bit of jQuery?
* The developer hiring process
* Maybe a little bit of that Javascript language, or something?
* Probably not much at all on HTML, because HTML doesn't need... notes... really
* CSS... lol, CSS.
* People, and the experience of dealing with people on a regular basis
* What it's like to live with the people I live with
* What it's like to actually find myself liking human beings, and wanting to be around them, especially certain ones, quite a lot. (It's _weird!_)
