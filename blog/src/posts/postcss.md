so, it's basically just a sort of build tool plugin api.

can be used as a build tool plugin. uhm.

postcss-cli is a thing.

i guess probably most of the css things i use are available
as plugins here anyway. (obviously autoprefixer and cssnext,
but also probably) stylus (i hope), cssnano/csso, stylelint,
bem/suit stuff, et-OH MY GOD A SEARCH ON THE WEBSITE SHOWS NO
STYLUS PLUGINS WHAT oh wait it's okay a search on npm shows
two, we're saved.
