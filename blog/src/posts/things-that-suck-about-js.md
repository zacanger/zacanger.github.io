asked some people what they dislike about js, just out of curiosity.
results are predictable.

in no particular order:

* events (dom events, event cycle, event loop)
* js fatigue
* this (context)
* es6 classes/oo idea prevalence
* mobile safari even existing
* internet explorer/edge
* no type system
* everything DOM related
* no real immutable values
* lack of neat syntax tools found in new languages (simple shit like range operators)
* the way everyone else writes it
