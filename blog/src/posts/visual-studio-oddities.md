Some Visual Studio oddities:

* undo is ctrl-z, but
* redo is shift-alt-backspace.
* there's no 'revert to saved' (which even basic text editors have)
* shift-tab only works if you have multiple lines selected
* jump-to-matching-symbol (`%` in vim) only works sometimes
* there's no search-in-open-buffers, i think
* commenting out code: `ctrl-k ctrl-c`
* selecting text and hitting quotes will delete the text, not wrap in quotes
* line-numbers are off by default
* menus upon menus upon menus, each one slower than the last

I'm sure it's a really great IDE for C# people, but goddamn, it's slow. It also
has that horrible problem where you need to have Windows to use it.
