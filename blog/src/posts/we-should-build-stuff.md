one thing that bugs me, as a person who does computers for a living, is that people who do computers for a living suck at sharing our progress with the rest of the world.

if writers, musicians, visual artists, bloggers, even people we work with like marketing folks and UX designers, had any idea how cool the tools are that we’ve built for ourselves, we could have a thousand new amazing businesses to build.

in the writing space alone, we could build tools based on vim, pandoc, alex, git, rsync, latex, and probably more that i’m not thinking of.

i know Abstract exists and that's awesome, but it's only one very narrow, specific problem. why aren't we solving other problems that way? we have cool shiny stuff and it works really well, mostly. and people are emailing themselves drafts so they don't lose their work if their computer dies, like it's 1995. why don't we build more cool stuff for other people who create cool stuff?

i want to help people make cool stuff, and it pisses me off that the best advice i can offer people is "learn git and get bitbucket because you get free private repos" and also "stop using microsoft products, you can't diff a docx"

anyway i don't have a point, i'm just annoyed that programmers have all these cool toys and we haven't done anything useful for anyone else with them, we've just made our own lives better.
