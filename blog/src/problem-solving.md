**The Four Steps:**

* Understand the current situation.
* Identify the root cause of the problem.
* Develop an effective action plan.
* Execute until the problem is solved, making modifications as necessary.

If you start collecting and analysing data without first clarifying the question
you are trying to answer, you're probably doing yourself more harm than good.
You'll end up drowning in a flood of information and realise only later that
most of that research was a waste of time.
