I wrote this on Mastodon but decided to cross-post for whatever reason.
One of my biggest pet peeves is when people talk about how great foo-lang is
as an alernative to bar-lang, & it turns out they're just shit at bar-lang, or
write deliberately bad bar-lang in examples to try to make foo-lang look
better. Don't do that. If you can't write decent, idiomatic bar-lang, you
don't get to hate it yet. If you _can_ and are writing it like someone who's
never read a tutorial on it intentionally, you're just making foo-lang's
community look like assholes.  Chances are foo-lang is pretty great, & can
stand up on its own merits. Talk about those, not how bad your half-assed
bar-lang is in comparison. I see this a lot with functional languages that
compile to JS, especially, & it's sad, because most of those languages are
actually really neat & there are a lot of good reasons to try them, but people
saying 'look how horrible this JS is compared to this other thing' when the JS
looks like it was written by someone who skimmed a jQuery tutorial once
_really_ doesn't present the community very well. So don't do that.

Also: a fun vim/Twitter trick (I also cross-posted this to Twitter): `:set
textwidth=140`, then `gq`. You're welcome.
