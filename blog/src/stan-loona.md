### Introduction

You wanna stan LOONA? Cool, you should. They're the best K-Pop group in the
history of K-Pop, for a few reasons:

* Lore (don't worry about that for now)
* Predebut project (don't worry about it)
* Music
* Cinematography
* The whole saga of the group and the fandom and all of it
* Personalities of the members

I'm not going to dive into all of those. Instead, this little guide will point
you to resources that will help you discover them on your own.

First things first: as of the time I'm writing this, there are 343 MP3s in my
LOONA discography directory, including 55 albums/singles/mini-albums. Don't
worry about most of them just yet.

### Level One

Watch these, in this order:

* [So What + Why Not? Live](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Og59rDfQ37Y)
* [Butterfly MV](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XEOCbFJjRw0)
* [PTT Dance Practice](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0OI-bcOWEUY)
* [Star MV](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zW-AIXAnLcE)
* [Cherry Bomb Dance Cover](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s7kxoMYg3l8)

Yeah there's a boycott on. Don't worry about it, you're not in that deep.

Next, check out Sonatine, Pose, Sweet Crazy Love, Love4Eva, and anything else
YouTube recommends to you, if you want to.

### Level Two

It's time for memes. Check out the most popular videos from [GirlsOf
OurMonth](https://www.youtube.com/@GOOMLOONA) for starters. Also check out
LOONIAN, Orbit Olight 2, Everyday Wizbit, Blackwhite, driftnorth, and other
great LOONA meme editors, if you want. The point here is to learn their
personalities.

### Level Three

More music. You need Universe, Where you at?, Pale Blue Dot, See Saw, Egoist,
Let Me In, Eclipse, Chaotic, Stylish, and A Different Night. Maybe just start
with a few and see how you're feeling. They have a LOT of music, so feel free to
self-direct if you find something you vibe with. At this point it would make
sense to start learning about [the subunits and history of the
group](https://loonatheworld.fandom.com/wiki/LOONA), at least a little bit.

### Level Four

Lore. Okay this is complicated because none of it is really official. I really
recommend [SuA's SinB](https://www.youtube.com/@SuAsSinB/videos), especially the
Eclipse Theory series, but it's long and really complex. You could also try the
Twinfish or Loominosity videos, or the lore guides on the wiki linked above.

Now also you should probably head to the
[subreddit](https://new.reddit.com/r/LOONA/new/) and check the megathreads in
the sidebar. Lots has been happening in the last year or so, so it's good to be
aware of where members are now and what all is going on with CTD, ARTMS, the
boycott, and all of it.

### Level Five

[Jaden](https://m.blog.naver.com/gxxd),
[BlockBerry](https://www.allkpop.com/article/2022/11/blockberry-creative-ceo-coo-suspected-of-evading-over-37-million-usd-in-taxes),
more memes (see above), more lore (see above), the whole debut project (see the
wiki); if you're going this deep, you're probably already an Orbit, so I don't
need to tell you where to go. It's a wild world here, down near the bottom of
the iceberg.

### Quick Notes

Don't feel pressured to go deep. If you like some of the music, just enjoy it.
If the memes are funny but you don't care about the lore, that's totally fine.
Personally I've been in this LOONA life since there were only three members, so
I've had time to slowly absorb all of this stuff. If I was getting into LOONA
just now, I honestly probably would not bother learning the lore, or the company
drama, or even about how Lee Soo-Man produced the only two albums outside of SM
just because he was impressed with LOONA's Cherry Bomb cover. Just bite off what
you can chew and don't let it overwhelm you.

Welcome to LOONA Island.
