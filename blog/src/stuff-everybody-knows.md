Takeaways from Laurie Voss's 'Stuff Everybody Knows Except You'

* Be good at your tools.
    * If you use Windows, be _good_ at Windows. Also, don't use Windows.
    * Know Bash. Also know Sed and Awk. But really, really, _really_ know Bash.
    * Be good at your editor. It doesn't matter which one. Notepad is not an editor.
* Don't fuck with users.
    * Paralaralaralax is the devil.
    * A button is an action. A link goes somewhere.
* Auth is not simple.
    * Identification: Hi, I'm this guy! (To people.)
    * Authentication: Hi, I can prove I'm this guy! (To a computer.)
    * Authorization: Hi, I am allowed to do these things!
    * Salt and hash your passwords. Always. (Bcrypt.)
* Security is not a joke.
    * Leave it to people who know what they're doing.
    * Or devote your career to doing this.
* Don't build rich web apps for everything.
    * If your site is all about content, build a plain old static site.
        * This seems obvious, but apparently it's not.
* Load content first. Fuck your fancy fonts, fuck your gifs, just load stuff.
* Speed over everything.
* Write and maintain tests. Test. Write testable code.
* Read the error logs. And write good error messages.
* Write obvious code.
* Get good at git.
* Automate all the things (with deployment, but also testing, CI, and everything else).
    * But don't go overboard (yak shaving).
* Break things up (use common patterns/modularise everything/decouple shit).
    * Also, keep in mind that everything you write is/has an API. Make it consistent.
