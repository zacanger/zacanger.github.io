Jesus fuck it's been an interesting week. I've learned so much this week, and
managed to get almost nothing done. [Markvi](http://npm.im/markvi) is up to
version 0.3.0, because it now actually has the keybinds it was always meant to
have. The tentatively titled _Whiteboard_ is stuck in planning, because I kind
of stopped caring about it, though I really need to get that one done since it's
the main project that actually matters, here. The other project (the thing that
has to do with documentation, and making money) is stalled, but I'm so ready to
get moving on that because it's super exciting.

This week was Thanksgiving. I spent the week holed up at home, working and
studying. I learned Vue (which I love), a bit of Mithril (which was nice), and
did quite a lot of workshopper type of things, and learned a wee bit of Ruby
(which was pretty nice, actually).

I also came across something close to dangerous, here. Goddammit. I hope this
won't be a problem. Actually, I'm pretty sure it won't, because other pepole
are smarter than I am, and better and handling adult relationships. I just...
met a person I'm rather fond of, a while back, and have grown much more fond
of in the past week.

ANYHOW, that's a non-thing, fortunately. NEXT.
