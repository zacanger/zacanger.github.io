<p>this is, i think, the first post of this year. happy 2016! i'm not blogging a whole lot, but really just trying to kill a few minute while my brain rests. lately i'm working a lot in new technologies that i've never touched before--react, which i still find irksome (though as before, i do <em>get</em> it), coffeescript (to play with the atom editor), firebase (still more magicc than really cool, but it does what it does, and we need what it does, so i'm using it), and some other new things.  but i wanted to take a minute off to talk about writing.</p>

<p>It's pretty crazy. I'm 99% sure I'm totally not ready, not even a little bit. As I keep saying when people ask, I know I know computers well enough, and I know I can pick things up well enough... I'm just really unfamiliar with Javascript and for some reason it doesn't stick well in my head. That's probably because I don't use it much for fun. It's not the language I'd reach for for most tasks, because (in stark contrast to most of the JS fanpersons on teh Github) I really don't believe it should be the default for a lot of things. Javascript has certainly outgrown the cheesy-animations-in-websites days, but why not use a shell script to do things that a shell script would be best for, and C to do things that should probably be done in C, and leave Javascript for doing things best handled in Javascript? Running a big, clunky, really not all that great engine just to handle using a language almost entirely based around working with the web... for doing stuff in the console? It's cool and all, yeah. I think it's really neat that I could replace most software I use with stuff installed straight from NPM--including the window manager, even. But why would I want to? Cool in theory, I guess, but if I'm using a tiling window manager the most hipster I'll get is Xmonad, and if I need an audio player chances are I'll go with (at most) MOC, not a JS clone of Mplayer.  </p>

<h3>Just a note:</h3>

<p>I'mma go ahead and deploy this now. I'm doing things the old fashioned way (that is, FTP) because IIS is the worst and it makes me sad. I've decided to stick with bashblog for the moment, only because baker is more than I need. So is bashblog, for that matter, but baker also brings along <a href="http://getbootstrap.com">Bootstrap</a> weight, and that's really not something I can see myself needing in blog context. Mostly I write things in Markdown, sometimes peeking in on them with a nifty live preview script to check things; I don't need widgets and animations and such, here.</p>

<p>Anyhow, I'll now begin the long work of cleaning up all these old posts for self-hosting. Thank goodness.</p>

<p>Note: this is older, but not actually old, just a week or two, pulled from my <a href="http://zacanger.tumblr.com">Tumblr account</a> for testing purposes.</p>

<p>Okay! Here we go.</p>

<h3>BLOGGY BLOGTIME.</h3>

<p>An attempt at this, anyway. <br />
I NEED A BLOGGING ENGINE. <br />
Seriously. I mean, static-site compiler. Whatever. There are so many out there, 
but I can't seem to find one that actually works for me. None of them seem
right.  </p>

<p>I'm literally editing text in a javascript bookmarklet that loads the Ace
editor, right now. Which is annoying a little bit, because it's got syntax 
highlighting and errors based on JS, &amp; obviously I'm writing in Markdown, so...
Oh, and I keep automatically returning when before I hit about 80 characters; 
that's kind of dumb. I need to write a new bookmarklet that pulls in Dillinger
or something.  </p>

<p>Hold on, actually....  </p>

This Here's A Test!
</a></h3>
<div class="subtitle">September 27, 2015  &mdash;

<p>Well, all right! This is just a little test. I've tried what may well be five or six dozen static site/blog generators over the past few months, and I'm back at two of the ones I tried first--<a href="https://github.com/cfenollosa/bashblog">Bashblog</a> and <a href="https://github.com/taylorchu/baker">Baker</a>. They're both written in bash, and both pretty simple. I dig bashblog's one-file thing, and kind of like the extreme simplicity of the post-editing format, but it's a little sloppy and requires some disassembly to actually configure. Baker's quite a bit easier to work with, and quite a bit more attractive by default, but it's also about three times the size of bashblog. Both of them seem to have Discus/disquszszs/diskust really stuck in there, and I'm not actually in the mood to sign up for yet <em>another</em> social platform, so... we'll have to see about that. OH, and neither one wants to use an alternate implementation of Markdown. not that I mind, there's nothing terribly wrong with the original one from <a href="http://daringfireball.net">John Gruber</a>, but I'd prefer to at least have that option. There are versions in C and Python that I like (and the C is obviously much faster), as well as the various Javascript implementations that are all the rage these days. It'd also be nice to work with some extensions. I'm never sure what's kosher in the original because I rarely use it, but I'm fairly certain I can't do tables and syntax hightlighting here.</p>

<p>ANYWAY. This is just a quick first post, as a test. I'll be doing the same in Baker, and then following up by (gradually) reposting all of my archived blog posts from other platforms, and saved drafts/notes in my Dropbox.</p>

<p>Cheers!</p>
