<p>Performance matters. That's just a thing. I really don't care all that much about the browser-side stuff, personally,
and I'm a wee bit sick of a lot of the client-side frameworks that have most of the market, because they mean you
really <em>have</em> to care about using a lot of JS in the browser... because that's where you're doing most of the work.
Things like Angular really show off this kind of horrible way of building apps. Putting all the work in every person's
browser sure makes a lot of sense if you've got one tiny SPA and you're serving it from a home netbook or whatever...
but come on, people. Stop hurting users. Be realistic. It's not even about doing what's probably actually the <em>right</em>
thing to do... it can, if you want, just be about the dollar. Users don't want to wait. No one wants to wait. Sending
out a whole bunch of scripts to a three-year-old knockoff tablet from China that's running on DSL out in the country
and then figuring that user is okay with waiting while their device slowly loads it all in and slooowly runs the
scripts and then finally starts showing them the goddamn site they're trying to see... that's how you lose people.
There are truckloads of studies out there about the negative impact of every millisecond, so I won't keep rambling, and
will start getting down to some note-taking and summarizing.... Oh, right. I'm reading through
<a href="https://browserdiet.com/en/">this little guide</a>, right now, so that's what sparked this. I know I've read it before,
but I'm really hardcore procrastinating learning Redux right now, so I figured I'd do something else. This is actually
in my school notes directory, but it may end up as a blog post. Certainly sounds like it. Who knows?</p>

<p>...to be done with this website, and be done with this 'client.' It's the 4th of October. I'm literally getting on a bus on the 6th and going most of the way across the country, and will not be spending one tiny bit of effort on this ever again.</p>
