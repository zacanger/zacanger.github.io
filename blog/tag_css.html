<p>A somewhat modified version of the document fount <a href="http://f2em.com">here</a></p>

<ul>
<li><strong>USERS</strong> are the most important part of what I do.
<ul>
<li>The users' needs come first.</li>
<li>What I want, as a developer, is much less vital.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Progressive enhancement is the most important phrase I know.
<ul>
<li>WIthout JS, without Webkit, without even CSS, what I build will still function.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Simplicity is respect.
<ul>
<li>Unnecessary complexity, whether in code or in design, should always be fought.</li>
<li>Simple interfaces mean minimal mental overhead.</li>
<li>Complicated interactions and designs are taxing.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Choices matter; I will help the people I can influence make good ones.
<ul>
<li>Web browsers are not all created equal.</li>
<li>Software that does not implement web standards, or which is not responsive to the advancement of the web, should be recommended against.</li>
<li>The choice of browser is especially important on mobile devices, where Safari will result in broken websites.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>I believe in the openness of the web.
<ul>
<li>Flash should be fought, tooth and nail.</li>
<li>Proprietary formats should never enter my work.</li>
<li>Device-independent content first.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Performance is critical.
<ul>
<li>I understand that HTTP requests mean latency, and latency means frustrated and lost users.</li>
<li>I understand that my hardware is not representative of the real world, and will be mindful of limited hardware and low bandwith.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>I will never stop educating myself.
<ul>
<li>I will learn from the root, rather than beginning with abstractions: Javascript before jQuery, CSS before Sass, et cetera.</li>
<li>I will better myself not just in code and maths, but also in art, music, design, research, and the study of usability.</li>
<li>I understand that I cannot learn everything, and will be mindful of what I do not know.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>I believe that Free and Open Source code and software are the future of the web.
<ul>
<li>When considering file formats and media codecs, open is always better.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>I will never underestimate the importance of accessibility.
<ul>
<li>Users who may have trouble differentiating colours or difficulty reading small fonts are not <em>all</em> of accessibility.</li>
<li>Users who prefer to use the keyboard, or print content, or browse on limited devices, matter too.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>I will contribute.
<ul>
<li>Giving back to the community, in the form of bugfixes, workarounds, polyfills, snippets, raised issues, documentation, and any other form is imperative.</li>
<li>This is how the web grows. This is how the development community grows.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>I accept responsibility for <code>view-source:</code>
<ul>
<li>I will use future-safe code.</li>
<li>I will always prefer feature detection over user-agent sniffing.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>My code is portable.
<ul>
<li>Overzealous CSS specificity and the polution of the global Javascript namespace will be avoided.</li>
<li>I will be mindful of browser quirks.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>I will choose the right tool for the job.
<ul>
<li>Whether a choice between large frameworks, or small libraries, or languages, or even preprocessors, I will educate myself.</li>
<li>I will learn from the mistakes others have made to help me make the right choice for my project.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>I will create applications with security in mind.
<ul>
<li>My code will be properly escaped to help prevent XSS and CSRF.</li>
<li>I will not store sensitive information in cookies.</li>
<li>I will avoid cookies unless there are no alternatives.</li>
<li>I will use HTTPS wherever appropriate.</li>
<li>I will be responsive in correcting any issues that may harm the users of my code.</li>
</ul></li>

CSS Preprocessors

<p>Less is kind of just the same as CSS, plus mixins and variables. Yay.... It's in Javascript. Really not a much better way to write CSS.</p>

<p>Sass (which is officially <em>not</em> in all caps!) is okay. Whitespace significant nesting, no semicolons or braces in the <code>.sass</code> format (the <code>.scss</code> is a strict superset of CSS, and does need all the usual punctuation), it takes variables, mixins, and partials (basically variables in a separate file), and can do basic math in-line. It's written in Ruby, and was one of the first (if not <em>the</em> first) CSS preprocessors.</p>

<p>Stylus is really nice. It's in JS, doesn't need much punctuation, nesting is (like Sass) based on whitespace, and it can take regular CSS. Doesn't need braces, colons, commas, semicolons, can use in-language functions, and it's all really optional, so you can mix and match, even in the same file. You do need to use commas when you have selectors that look like properties (so <code>foo bar baz, p span code</code>). The <code>&amp;</code> refers to the parent selector(s). Interpolation works by using <code>{}</code> around the expression, eg <code>-webkit-{'border' + '-radius'}</code>. <br />
Nib is a library for Stylus, which gives you a bunch of really convenient mixins, including browser prefixing. This has to be installed locally (no CLI). <br />
Styl is based on Rework (a plugin system for CSS). It's not quite as featureful as Stylus, but it's quite a bit faster than Stylus, includes all of Rework's features and plugins, has an executable, automatically throws vendor prefixing on regular CSS, and can use Sass/Stylus-style whitespace (for nesting and references to parent selectors).</p>

UI
</a></h3>
<div class="subtitle">January 13, 2016  &mdash;

<!-- text begin -->

<h2>UI</h2>

<h3>Systems</h3>

<ul>
<li>Modular is good</li>
<li>Cards are good</li>
<li>Systems are good</li>
<li>Consistency is good</li>
</ul>

<h4>Future Trends:</h4>

<ul>
<li>Design systems</li>
<li>Designing for change</li>
<li>Designing personalized experiences</li>
</ul>

<p><a href="http://blog.intercom.io/design-futures-1-creating-systems-not-products/">Systems mean fast iteration means success.</a></p>

<h3>Elements</h3>

<p>Interfaces are composed of small components, which are composed of small primitives. <br />
This lowest granular level only consists of a few elements:</p>

<ul>
<li>Buttons</li>
<li>Forms</li>
<li>Lists</li>
</ul>

<p>Everything else is usually a superset of these elements.</p>

<h3>Trends</h3>

<p>Don't buy into the hype. Not everything is a good thing. A lot of things are actually <br />
really bad things, especially for the users you might not be considering.</p>

<ul>
<li>Parallax -- good for flashiness, bad for a11y, users, browsers</li>
<li>Card -- good all around, for the right application</li>
<li>Media object -- an example of the <em>elements</em> way of doings, the 'poster child of oocss'</li>
<li>Infinite scroll -- again, looks cool, but all around actually a very bad thing to do</li>
<li>Smooth scroll -- it's not necessarily harmful, but it's not exactly fantastic, either</li>
</ul>

<h3>Natural Language Form</h3>

<p>Forms that aren't just inputs. Mad-libs style, so one doesn't have a giant box of empty <br />
boxes to fill in, but instead something like
<a href="http://www.lukew.com/ff/entry.asp?1007">I want my username to be {username} and my password to be {password}</a>, or 
<a href="http://www.jroehm.com/2014/01/ui-pattern-natural-language-form/">I'm looking for {restaurant} in {city} at {time}.</a></p>

<h3>Empty States</h3>

<ul>
<li>Zero-data states</li>
<li><a href="https://www.google.com/design/spec/patterns/empty-states.html">When there's no content</a></li>
<li>Should not just be an afterthought</li>
<li><a href="http://emptystat.es">Excellent Examples</a></li>
</ul>

<p>So, I have a <em>lot</em> of notes that I've taken over the course of the last couple of months. Seeing as they're not doing me a whole lot of good sitting in a pile of Markdown files, I'm gradually going through them, cleaning them up, and I think I'll just post them all as sort of blog posts. Why not? So here's a little list of the topics I'll be covering over the next few weeks:</p>

<li>I like Node a lot</li>
<li>Maybe a little bit of jQuery?</li>
<li>The developer hiring process</li>
<li>Maybe a little bit of that Javascript language, or something?</li>
<li>Probably not much at all on HTML, because HTML doesn't need... notes... really</li>
<li>CSS... lol, CSS.</li>
<li>People, and the experience of dealing with people on a regular basis</li>
<li>What it's like to live with the people I live with</li>

Front-End Performance Notes
</a></h3>
<div class="subtitle">December 28, 2015  &mdash; 
Zac Anger</div>
<!-- text begin -->

<p>Performance matters. That's just a thing. I really don't care all that much about the browser-side stuff, personally,
and I'm a wee bit sick of a lot of the client-side frameworks that have most of the market, because they mean you
really <em>have</em> to care about using a lot of JS in the browser... because that's where you're doing most of the work.
Things like Angular really show off this kind of horrible way of building apps. Putting all the work in every person's
browser sure makes a lot of sense if you've got one tiny SPA and you're serving it from a home netbook or whatever...
but come on, people. Stop hurting users. Be realistic. It's not even about doing what's probably actually the <em>right</em>
thing to do... it can, if you want, just be about the dollar. Users don't want to wait. No one wants to wait. Sending
out a whole bunch of scripts to a three-year-old knockoff tablet from China that's running on DSL out in the country
and then figuring that user is okay with waiting while their device slowly loads it all in and slooowly runs the
scripts and then finally starts showing them the goddamn site they're trying to see... that's how you lose people.
There are truckloads of studies out there about the negative impact of every millisecond, so I won't keep rambling, and
will start getting down to some note-taking and summarizing.... Oh, right. I'm reading through
<a href="https://browserdiet.com/en/">this little guide</a>, right now, so that's what sparked this. I know I've read it before,
but I'm really hardcore procrastinating learning Redux right now, so I figured I'd do something else. This is actually
in my school notes directory, but it may end up as a blog post. Certainly sounds like it. Who knows?</p>

<p>In the interest of <a href="http://coffeecoder.net/blog/blog-little-things/">blogging the little things</a>, I want to write down a couple of things I learned while struggling through <a href="https://github.com/zacanger/ayuba.git">my project</a>. Nothing major, but a few things that I really had to dig to find answers to, buried way underneath unrelated issues in Github and whatnot.</p>

<p>We're staring that today, and this is exciting. I never hated CSS until Bootstrap, but now I think I'd rather debug a hypothetical program written in both PHP and assembler than have to deal with bad CSS ever again. And I don't know any assembly languages.</p>

<p>So far today, everything actually makes sense. It's not easy or simple, but it's logical. I can see that mindmaps, or some similar diagraming/mapping tool, could be super useful for larger projects, though. Or even medium-ish projects. Keeping track of what's returning what to where and which functions are calling which other functions and all these things, it could very easily scramble the brains.</p>

<p>I've starting using Vim, too, which is another whole level of lifelong education, but I know that now that I've got the basics down, I'll probably never have trouble picking an editor again. I'm specifically using <a href="https://neovim.io/">Neovim</a>, which is not nearly as ridiculous and bloated and slow as Vim itself (thank fuck). It's taking a bit to get used to certain commands, and I'm still not exactly sure what counts as a word when I type, for example, <code>d4e</code>, but I'm getting there, and it's super exciting because I've finally found an editor that not only works (and works <em>well</em>, unlike the horde of bloated-text-editor-meets-cut-down-IDE deals), and doesn't require endless paren-mashing to work with (lookin' at you, Emacs), and has quick and easy keybinds (again, Emacs, what are you doing with yourself and why would anyone want to press seven keys simultaneously and in various combinations just to do simple things?) that mostly kind of make sense.</p>

<p>So that's cool. I just need to spend some time to learn how to set things up, I guess. Syntax highlighting works fine, but I have to turn it on every time I open a file. No autocompletion by default, it seems, and the indent levels are all sorts of wrong (hey four-spacers, you need to get help...).</p>

<p>Anyway, here's just a quick blog post. Now that we're starting to learn to program, I have a feeling I'll be too busy to think, most days, so maybe no updates for a wee bit.</p>
