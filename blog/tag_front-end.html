<p>A somewhat modified version of the document fount <a href="http://f2em.com">here</a></p>

<ul>
<li><strong>USERS</strong> are the most important part of what I do.
<ul>
<li>The users' needs come first.</li>
<li>What I want, as a developer, is much less vital.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Progressive enhancement is the most important phrase I know.
<ul>
<li>WIthout JS, without Webkit, without even CSS, what I build will still function.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Simplicity is respect.
<ul>
<li>Unnecessary complexity, whether in code or in design, should always be fought.</li>
<li>Simple interfaces mean minimal mental overhead.</li>
<li>Complicated interactions and designs are taxing.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Choices matter; I will help the people I can influence make good ones.
<ul>
<li>Web browsers are not all created equal.</li>
<li>Software that does not implement web standards, or which is not responsive to the advancement of the web, should be recommended against.</li>
<li>The choice of browser is especially important on mobile devices, where Safari will result in broken websites.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>I believe in the openness of the web.
<ul>
<li>Flash should be fought, tooth and nail.</li>
<li>Proprietary formats should never enter my work.</li>
<li>Device-independent content first.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Performance is critical.
<ul>
<li>I understand that HTTP requests mean latency, and latency means frustrated and lost users.</li>
<li>I understand that my hardware is not representative of the real world, and will be mindful of limited hardware and low bandwith.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>I will never stop educating myself.
<ul>
<li>I will learn from the root, rather than beginning with abstractions: Javascript before jQuery, CSS before Sass, et cetera.</li>
<li>I will better myself not just in code and maths, but also in art, music, design, research, and the study of usability.</li>
<li>I understand that I cannot learn everything, and will be mindful of what I do not know.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>I believe that Free and Open Source code and software are the future of the web.
<ul>
<li>When considering file formats and media codecs, open is always better.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>I will never underestimate the importance of accessibility.
<ul>
<li>Users who may have trouble differentiating colours or difficulty reading small fonts are not <em>all</em> of accessibility.</li>
<li>Users who prefer to use the keyboard, or print content, or browse on limited devices, matter too.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>I will contribute.
<ul>
<li>Giving back to the community, in the form of bugfixes, workarounds, polyfills, snippets, raised issues, documentation, and any other form is imperative.</li>
<li>This is how the web grows. This is how the development community grows.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>I accept responsibility for <code>view-source:</code>
<ul>
<li>I will use future-safe code.</li>
<li>I will always prefer feature detection over user-agent sniffing.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>My code is portable.
<ul>
<li>Overzealous CSS specificity and the polution of the global Javascript namespace will be avoided.</li>
<li>I will be mindful of browser quirks.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>I will choose the right tool for the job.
<ul>
<li>Whether a choice between large frameworks, or small libraries, or languages, or even preprocessors, I will educate myself.</li>
<li>I will learn from the mistakes others have made to help me make the right choice for my project.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>I will create applications with security in mind.
<ul>
<li>My code will be properly escaped to help prevent XSS and CSRF.</li>
<li>I will not store sensitive information in cookies.</li>
<li>I will avoid cookies unless there are no alternatives.</li>
<li>I will use HTTPS wherever appropriate.</li>
<li>I will be responsive in correcting any issues that may harm the users of my code.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

Front-End Performance Notes
</a></h3>
<div class="subtitle">December 28, 2015  &mdash;

<p>Performance matters. That's just a thing. I really don't care all that much about the browser-side stuff, personally,
and I'm a wee bit sick of a lot of the client-side frameworks that have most of the market, because they mean you
really <em>have</em> to care about using a lot of JS in the browser... because that's where you're doing most of the work.
Things like Angular really show off this kind of horrible way of building apps. Putting all the work in every person's
browser sure makes a lot of sense if you've got one tiny SPA and you're serving it from a home netbook or whatever...
but come on, people. Stop hurting users. Be realistic. It's not even about doing what's probably actually the <em>right</em>
thing to do... it can, if you want, just be about the dollar. Users don't want to wait. No one wants to wait. Sending
out a whole bunch of scripts to a three-year-old knockoff tablet from China that's running on DSL out in the country
and then figuring that user is okay with waiting while their device slowly loads it all in and slooowly runs the
scripts and then finally starts showing them the goddamn site they're trying to see... that's how you lose people.
There are truckloads of studies out there about the negative impact of every millisecond, so I won't keep rambling, and
will start getting down to some note-taking and summarizing.... Oh, right. I'm reading through
<a href="https://browserdiet.com/en/">this little guide</a>, right now, so that's what sparked this. I know I've read it before,
but I'm really hardcore procrastinating learning Redux right now, so I figured I'd do something else. This is actually
in my school notes directory, but it may end up as a blog post. Certainly sounds like it. Who knows?</p>
