<p>everyone here is here to learn <br />
everyone here has something to gain from being here <br />
i don't understand the idea that it's okay to slack off <br />
on doing the basic required work, but take up other people's time <br />
asking questions that, while perfectly valid, are generally answered <br />
either in said required reading, or within the first five results <br />
on google. <br />
i can't keep doing this, because we're now doing things that i actually <br />
really don't know how to do. losing significant amounts of study time <br />
to googling things for other people is not an effective way to learn <br />
anything, i think.</p>

<p>That's about to start. I'm tired and I can't focus, and I'm losing a very dear friend to her demons and I can't seem to do anything about it no matter how much time I spend on the phone, because at some point I need to turn it off and try to catch up on work. She's going to die, and I'm not going to be there to stop it, and it wouldn't matter if I was because nothing would stop her except one specific asshole completely changing everything about himself and being who he must have, at some point, said he was.</p>

<p>So, that's going on. But on the other hand... Javascript is good. Um.</p>
