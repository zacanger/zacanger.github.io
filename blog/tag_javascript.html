<p>Notes taken while going through
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCO1cgjhGzsSYb1rsB4bFe4Q/videos">this guy's videos</a>.</p>

<p>You should watch them all. He's great.</p>

<pre><code>'use strict'

//
// HOF
//
// Higher Order Functions
// functions are values
// const something = function &gt; function something
// obvs functions passed into functions
// composition yay
// example: filter (method on array, takes another function as action)
// filter's should return true or false to determine whether item belongs in arr
let something = [{foo : 'bar'}, {quux : 'baz'}, {whatever : 'target'}]
let newArr
for (let i = 0; i &lt; something.length; i++) {
  if (something[i].what === 'target') {
    newArr.push(something[i])
  }
}
// vs
let newArr = something.filter(thing =&gt; {
  return thing.what === 'target'
})
// or, using reject
let isTarget = something =&gt; thing.what === 'target'
let notTarget = something.reject(isTarget)
// note: there's also find. that returns just the first item that matches.

//
// Map
//
// map's cb returns a transformed object to put into array
let peeps = [
  {name : 'geordyn', relationship : 'bffl'                   }
, {name : 'erin'   , relationship : 'number one bro'         }
, {name : 'ryan'   , relationship : 'nemesis. also, the one.'}
, {name : 'andrew' , relationship : 'special mormon'         }
, {name : 'sarah'  , relationship : 'grandma'                }
]
// non-functional way of doing getting an array of the names
let names = []
for (let i = 0; i &lt; something.length; i++) {
  names.push(something[i].name)
}
// vs
let names = peeps.map(peep =&gt; peep.name)
let about = peeps.map(peep =&gt; peep.name + ' is my ' + peep.relationship + '.')

//
// Reduce
//
// map, filter, reject, and find are fairly specific list transformations.
// reduce is is more of a swiss-army knife. it can do just about anything.
// reduce wants an object, though. (yes, it's a method on the array prototype.)
let stuffToSum = [
  {amount : 4   }
, {amount : 16  }
, {amount : 1024}
, {amount : 4096}
]
// so...
let total = 0
for (let i = 0; i &lt; stuffToSum.length; i++) {
  total += stuffToSum[i].amount
}
// vs
let total = stuffToSum.reduce((sum, stuff) =&gt; sum + stuff.amount, 0)
// this is adding stuffToSum[0].amount to sum (which is initialised at 0)
// and returning that sum, then going again with stuffToSum[1].amount and
// the current sum (4), and so on.
//
// let's say we have some file in TSV format, like below. (i'm using 4 spaces
// to represent a tab here, since tabs = 2 spaces in all my editors, and 2 spaces
// isn't large enough to clearly distinguish fields here, i think.)
// miss lady    an item    7    20
// miss lady    a thing or two    75    2
// some dude    another product    33    9
// some dude    some product    100    1
// we need to transform this into a nice looking object (containing two objects,
// one for each person, each containing an array of objects that are the items bought).
import fs from 'fs'
let contents = fs.readFileSync('./thatFile.tsv', 'utf8')
.trim()                        // remove trailing newline
.split('\n')                   // split into array of strings at newlines
.map(line =&gt; line.split('\t')) // \t is a tab character
.reduce((persons, line) =&gt; {
  persons[line[0]] = persons[line[0]] || []
  persons[line[0]].push({
    name  : line[1]
  , cost  : line[2]
  , quant : line[3]
  })
  return persons
}, {})
console.log('contents: ', JSON.stringify(contents, null, 2))

//
// Closures
//
function sendReq(){
  let reqId = 'asdf'
  $.ajax({
    url : '/someurl'
  , success(response){
      console.log('request ' + reqId + ' returned')
    }
  })
}
// see, we don't have to pass stuff around here. reqId is going to be 'asdf'
// no matter when jquery's ajax finishes whatever it's doing. nice.
// there's also this classic example:
function makeAdder(x){
  return(y =&gt; x + y)
}
let

//
// Currying
//
// so, you've got some arguments. you could have a function that
// takes your bunch of arguments and does stuff with them. or you could
// have a function that takes your first argument and winds up returning
// a function that takes your second argument which returns a function
// that takes your third argument... etc., you get the idea.
let self1 = (name, age, language, location) =&gt;
  `Hi, I'm ${name}, age ${age}. I speak ${language} and live in ${location}.`

// vs
let self2 = name =&gt; age =&gt; language =&gt; location =&gt;
  `Hi, I'm ${name}, age ${age}. I speak ${language} and live in ${location}.`
console.log(self2('zac')(26)('english')('utah, i guess'))
// why? maybe i don't know everything about myself yet, but my app will find
// out some of this information later. so i call self('zac'), have a birthday,
// call self(27)('english') because it's been another year and i still only
// speak one language, and then i call self('texas??') because i've moved.
// now, finally, i have the return value (the introductory sentence)!
// what about self1? we could always use something from some library to
// transform it, like wu.js's autoCurry, or whatever. for the sake of familiarity,
// try lodash (first npm i -S lodash):
import _ from 'lodash'
let me = _.curry(self1)
console.log(self1('zac'))
// yay! okay, another example.
let

let isTypeCur = _.curry((type, obj) =&gt; obj.type === type)
  , acoustics = guitars.filter(isTypeCur('acoustic'))

//
// Recursion
//
// recursion is not at all a difficult idea. won't even
// bother laying it out here, really. a function calls itself
// until it's done calling itself. it's a super useful way to
// program, especially in actual functional languages.
// es6 makes recursion a lot nicer. we can get rid of the
// if statement in the below function in es6 because we won't
// end with a 'RangeError: Maximum call stack size exceeded
// or whatever.

<p>There are a whole whole bunch! Here's most of 'em, kinda hopefully split up
and sorted in some sort of order that makes sense. It's always worth just
taking a peek at the spec or MDN or whatever, especially it looks like actual
standards are going to be getting actual changes within actual human lifespans
now.</p>

<p><code>let</code> = <code>var</code>, but block scoped, <em>finally</em>. this means no leaks. Let can't be redeclared outside of its block, because it doesn't exist outside of there.</p>

<p><code>const</code> = <code>var</code>, but it's a constant, <em>finally</em>. this means variables you can't fuck with, man! for simple things, that is. <code>const x = 2; x = 3</code> does <em>not</em> work. however, parts of a <code>const</code> are mutable; that is, <code>const y = [0, 1, 2, 3]; y[0] = 7</code> <em>does</em> work. Constants can be global or local, that's just up to how you declare it. Const and let behave the same no matter where you declare them; the difference is that const can't be <em>defined</em> again, whereas let <em>can</em> be redefined. <em>Neither</em> of them can be <em>declared</em> again.</p>

<h3><a class="ablack" href="electron-and-nwjs.html">
Electron and NW.js
</a></h3>
<div class="subtitle">January 15, 2016  &mdash; 
Zac Anger</div>
<!-- text begin -->

<p>Electron (formerly known as Atom Shell) and NW.js (formerly known as Node Webkit) are similar projects that bring Javascript to the desktop. They're both based on browser runtimes. Electron is sponsored by Github, and uses libchromiumcontent and Webkit 537 (as of Autumn 2015). NW.js is sponsored by Intel and uses Chromium and Blink/Webkit 537. They both use the V8 JS engine (from Chrome), are fully open source (MIT Licensed), can access a variety of open and licensed codecs, work on Unix-like systems (and, with a little extra work, on Windows), and can use Flash (in Electron's case, through the Pepper plugin). The biggest difference I've had in working with them is that Electron, being currently more popular (likely because of the Github support, and the popularity of the Atom editor, which is built on Electron) is usually closer to the current version of Chromium, and NW.js is usually a few versions behind. Electron seems to have a lot more community activity around it right now, too, so there are a lot of useful NPM packages like <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/electron-prebuilt">Electron-Prebuilt</a> (and <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/electron-prebuilt-lite">a lite version</a>) and <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/electron-packager">Electron-Packager</a> (and <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/electron-packager-interactive">an interactive version!</a>). Electron also needs a Javascript entry point, which looks something like this:</p>

<pre><code>var app           = require('app')  
  , BrowserWindow = require('browser-window')  
require('crash-reporter').start()  

var mainWindow = null  

app.on('window-all-closed', function(){  
  if(process.platform != 'darwin'){  
      app.quit()  
  }  
})  
app.on('ready', function(){  
  mainWindow = new BrowserWindow({  
    width                : 1200  
  , height               : 800  
  , 'accept-first-mouse' : true  
  , 'title-bar-style'    : 'hidden'  
  , 'node-integration'   : false  
  })  
  mainWindow.loadUrl('http://127.0.0.1:9090')  
  mainWindow.on('closed', function(){  
    mainWindow = null  
  })  
})  
</code></pre>

<p>That 'node-integration' line is <em>really important</em> if you want to use certain client-side libraries like Angular or jQuery that use the word 'module;' your stuff will just completely break without it.</p>

<p>NW.js, on the other hand, can just be pointed at your <code>index.html</code>, and that's enough to get started. That's really convenient, but for my own uses I've found that Electron has a lot more options. Its binaries are significantly larger, but there are evidently ways to cut them down. Don't count on being able to build an Electron app in less than a hundred megs, though.</p>

<p>If you're doing something small, like a text editor or some other little widgety kind of app, you'd probably still be better off with Qt or GTK--you can write a full text editor in GTK-Webkit with Python in less than 16kb, and that's if need a full rich-text interface with buttons and such. But for larger apps, and especially for apps you've already written for the browser, NW.js and Electron are both really great options. If you're going to be relying on a lot of the Node environment, Electron's got a better interface to Node because of its separated rendering and browser engines, but you do have to keep in mind that you'll be limited as to what client-side libraries you can use.</p>

<h3><a class="ablack" href="differences-from-js.html">
Elm (notes)
</a></h3>
<div class="subtitle">January 14, 2016  &mdash; 
Zac Anger</div>
<!-- text begin -->

<p>Differences from JS:</p>

<ul>
<li>Elm has multiline string support, with <em>triple</em> sets of quotes, eg """multiline string"""</li>
<li>Elm <em>cannot</em> use single quotes for <em>strings</em>. Elm uses single quotes to denote <em>characters</em>.</li>
<li>Booleans are uppercase.</li>
<li>Objects use <code>=</code> instead of <code>:</code>, so <code>{key: value, key2: value2}</code> in JS would be <code>{key = value, key2 = value2}</code> in Elm.</li>
<li><code>point.x = 42</code> in JS would be <code>{point | x = 42}</code> in Elm.</li>
<li>Functions are greatly simplified. <code>function(foo, bar){return foo+bar}</code> in js would be <code>\foo bar -&gt; foo + bar</code> in Elm.</li>
<li>Math is a little simpler: <code>Math.max(2,4)</code> is just <code>max 2 4</code>. Same with <code>min</code>. <code>Math.pow</code> is just <code>^</code>, eg <code>Math.min(1, Math.pow(2, 4))</code> is <code>min 1 (2^4)</code>.</li>
<li><code>numbers.map(Math.sqrt)</code> would be <code>List.map sqrt numbers</code>. <code>points.map(function(p){return p.x})</code> becomes <code>List.map .x points</code>.</li>
<li><code>2 &lt; 4 ? 'WHAT' : 'how?'</code>, <code>if 2 &lt; 4 then "WHAT" else "how?"</code></li>
<li><code>var foo = 72</code>; <code>let foo = 72 in...</code></li>
<li>No return statements; everything is an expression.</li>
<li><code>String.length "asdf"</code> rather than 'asdf.length'</li>
</ul>

<p>Mostly it looks pretty neat, but there's virtually nothing out there for actually <em>learning</em> it, so I'm already kind of over it....</p>

<p>Note that the 'EventLog.elm' in this directory doesn't actually need the start-app package anymore; turns out it's really easy to just wire the damn thing up all on your own.</p>

Front-End Performance Notes

<!-- text begin -->

<p>Performance matters. That's just a thing. I really don't care all that much about the browser-side stuff, personally,
and I'm a wee bit sick of a lot of the client-side frameworks that have most of the market, because they mean you
really <em>have</em> to care about using a lot of JS in the browser... because that's where you're doing most of the work.
Things like Angular really show off this kind of horrible way of building apps. Putting all the work in every person's
browser sure makes a lot of sense if you've got one tiny SPA and you're serving it from a home netbook or whatever...
but come on, people. Stop hurting users. Be realistic. It's not even about doing what's probably actually the <em>right</em>
thing to do... it can, if you want, just be about the dollar. Users don't want to wait. No one wants to wait. Sending
out a whole bunch of scripts to a three-year-old knockoff tablet from China that's running on DSL out in the country
and then figuring that user is okay with waiting while their device slowly loads it all in and slooowly runs the
scripts and then finally starts showing them the goddamn site they're trying to see... that's how you lose people.
There are truckloads of studies out there about the negative impact of every millisecond, so I won't keep rambling, and
will start getting down to some note-taking and summarizing.... Oh, right. I'm reading through
<a href="https://browserdiet.com/en/">this little guide</a>, right now, so that's what sparked this. I know I've read it before,
but I'm really hardcore procrastinating learning Redux right now, so I figured I'd do something else. This is actually
in my school notes directory, but it may end up as a blog post. Certainly sounds like it. Who knows?</p>

I <em>get</em> why people like React. <em>I get React</em>. It's not exactly hard to pick up, anyway. It's very logical and intuitive. And I really do like the concepts behind React.

<p>Look. I don't have anything against Angular on, like, a philosophical level. Or metaphysical. Or personal. I'm just not impressed. An MVC framework that makes templating easier and makes a lot of other things much more complicated? Client-side rendering? Bogging down browsers doing the heavy lifting so servers can respond a little faster? Very cool features. Very innovative. The year is 2008 and Javascript is starting to come into its own. Open source front-end libraries and frameworks are starting to pop up. Github was just founded. Angular is epic, right?</p>

<p>...is fun. Also a pain. But fun.  </p>

<p>I'm 239% sure I'm falling wayyy behind, but I'm also about 72% sure I started with a fairly decent headstart--not first in the cohort, for sure, but maybe around fifth. I think I'll catch up again (hush, I know it's not a race, but I don't want to be lagging) once we start back-end stuff. Maybe. Angular is nice and all, but for whatever reason I just can't seem to focus on it for long. Probably because somewhere deep down in my brain, I just can't bring myself to love the idea of that much client-side work. It feels like one of those really awesome things built by people who've never owned really shitty devices, or even average ones.</p>

<p>Take some concentration. Which, for me, takes a good bit of silence and, like, not needing to think about things other than what I'm trying to focus on. Kind of problematic, here. Silence and uninterrupted stretches of anything kind of don't exist when you're living with three other bachelors, and rooming with the youngest (and most talkative) of them.</p>

<p>Still... it's been a really crazy couple of weeks, and it's only going to get crazier. I suppose I'll be trying to move to a private room (and probably different apartment as well), come the interim... because I'm basically going to need every tiny bit of the break week(s) just to catch up.</p>

<p>That's about to start.

She's going to die, and I'm not going to be there to stop it, and it wouldn't matter if I was because nothing would stop her except one specific asshole completely changing everything about himself and being who he must have, at some point, said he was.</p>

<p>So, that's going on. But on the other hand... Javascript is good. Um.</p>

<p>We're staring that today, and this is exciting. I never hated CSS until Bootstrap, but now I think I'd rather debug a hypothetical program written in both PHP and assembler than have to deal with bad CSS ever again. And I don't know any assembly languages.</p>

<p>So far today, everything actually makes sense. It's not easy or simple, but it's logical. I can see that mindmaps, or some similar diagraming/mapping tool, could be super useful for larger projects, though. Or even medium-ish projects. Keeping track of what's returning what to where and which functions are calling which other functions and all these things, it could very easily scramble the brains.</p>

<p>I've starting using Vim, too, which is another whole level of lifelong education, but I know that now that I've got the basics down, I'll probably never have trouble picking an editor again. I'm specifically using <a href="https://neovim.io/">Neovim</a>, which is not nearly as ridiculous and bloated and slow as Vim itself (thank fuck). It's taking a bit to get used to certain commands, and I'm still not exactly sure what counts as a word when I type, for example, <code>d4e</code>, but I'm getting there, and it's super exciting because I've finally found an editor that not only works (and works <em>well</em>, unlike the horde of bloated-text-editor-meets-cut-down-IDE deals), and doesn't require endless paren-mashing to work with (lookin' at you, Emacs), and has quick and easy keybinds (again, Emacs, what are you doing with yourself and why would anyone want to press seven keys simultaneously and in various combinations just to do simple things?) that mostly kind of make sense.</p>

<p>So that's cool. I just need to spend some time to learn how to set things up, I guess. Syntax highlighting works fine, but I have to turn it on every time I open a file. No autocompletion by default, it seems, and the indent levels are all sorts of wrong (hey four-spacers, you need to get help...).</p>

<p>Anyway, here's just a quick blog post. Now that we're starting to learn to program, I have a feeling I'll be too busy to think, most days, so maybe no updates for a wee bit.</p>

<h3>The Technical Bit</h3>

<p>Jordan Last, speaker on Angular, client-side storage.</p>

<p>Problem: people want wikis, but don't like the word 'wiki.' (Yes, it's more complicated, but not so much so that a wiki wouldn't handle it).</p>

<p>Organization of survey site data (BYU Archaeology Dept.) &amp;c.; Android devices, needed compat. with iOS. This fellow ended up with <a href="http://ionic.io">Ionic</a> to handle building apps.</p>

<p>Okay, new question, how to work with storage? He checked out Cordova (PhoneGap), but wasn't into SQLite so much. Wanted straight-up persistant storage in the browser.</p>

<p>What options were there? Local, IndexedDB, WebSQL. Obviously IndexedDB isn't useful for people who want to stick with that Apple Webkit crap; Local storage is okay for... a little bit of stuff. They ended up choosing WebSQL (despite its deprecation), because they're big on relational databases and didn't want to get into Mongo or Node stuff. (Sidenote, this fellow doesn't quite grasp how the W3C works, or the problems with non-standard or deprecated technologies. Oh well.) Quick rundown on the very barest basics of ORM, aka Why We're Calling This A Model.</p>

<p>Looks like he's using <a href="https://github.com/coresmart/persistencejs">Persistence JS</a>. In persistence, you would save an object like, for example:</p>

<pre><code>persistence.add(this)
persistence.flush()
callback &amp;&amp; callback()
</code></pre>

<p>And now you have your whatsit all set. That's your save method. Then, say, <code>thingy.save(function);</code> and, y'know, there you go. Oh, wait. He forgot a bit about persistence. Needs <code>schema.sync</code> and a <code>.config</code> bit to get up and working.</p>

<p>Now, to query WebSQL in this kind of screwy setup (persistence-specific):</p>

<pre><code>whatever.getStuff = function(thingPassed, maybeAnother) {
  whatever.all().filter('thingPassed', '=' whateveritis); // i suppose i missed quite a bit here
}
</code></pre>

<p>And, finally, deleting... which evidently should be pretty easy. Too easy to go over.</p>

<h4>Closing points:</h4>

<ul>
<li>Never access the DB directly--do it through lots of Javascript and boilerplate and awkward ways.</li>
<li>Keep model-specific DB stuff with the model</li>
<li>Absolutely don't need to use persistence.js or WebSQL (thank goodness)</li>
<li>Use an ORM, silly!</li>
</ul>

<p>Oh, and the fellow who organized this thing maybe isn't aware of other stuff going on aroud here. LunchJS would be worth looking into.</p>

<p>And this Jordan fellow is interesting. Bit enthusiastic, dresses half his age, but information architecture + comp sci + dev + project management = all the things I'm really interested in, mostly, pretty much.</p>

<p>Oh, and it was kinda neat to check out Adobe's SLC building.</p>

<p>YESH. I'm in Provo, Utah, doing things that will eventually possibly hopefully make me skilled at something. Maybe even enough to get a job in that thing, and pay off the $$$ needed to get said education. Some quick observations:</p>

<ul>
<li>Utah is flat, bare, and bland</li>
<li>Salt Lake City is more like a small town</li>
<li>Provo is not a city by <em>any</em> stretch of the imagination</li>
<li>People here (here at this camp, specifically) are geeks, and really hardcore about it</li>
<li>They actually get excited about things like new features/conveniences in ES6</li>
<li>I'm more behind than I'd like to be, but not as far behind as some folk</li>
<li>The Mac users will never change their ways</li>

<p>It's pretty crazy. I'm 99% sure I'm totally not ready, not even a little bit. As I keep saying when people ask, I know I know computers well enough, and I know I can pick things up well enough... I'm just really unfamiliar with Javascript and for some reason it doesn't stick well in my head. That's probably because I don't use it much for fun. It's not the language I'd reach for for most tasks, because (in stark contrast to most of the JS fanpersons on teh Github) I really don't believe it should be the default for a lot of things. Javascript has certainly outgrown the cheesy-animations-in-websites days, but why not use a shell script to do things that a shell script would be best for, and C to do things that should probably be done in C, and leave Javascript for doing things best handled in Javascript? Running a big, clunky, really not all that great engine just to handle using a language almost entirely based around working with the web... for doing stuff in the console? It's cool and all, yeah. I think it's really neat that I could replace most software I use with stuff installed straight from NPM--including the window manager, even. But why would I want to? Cool in theory, I guess, but if I'm using a tiling window manager the most hipster I'll get is Xmonad, and if I need an audio player chances are I'll go with (at most) MOC, not a JS clone of Mplayer.  </p>
