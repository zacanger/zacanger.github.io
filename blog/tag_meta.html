<p>Another not-new post; from when I signed up for Pinterest, about a month ago.</p>

<h3>I Don't Know What I'm Doing</h3>

<p>I've never actually paid for online services. I don't really see the need to; if there's something that looks nifty, I'll usually figure out a way to do that thing myself. I'm really hoping Pinboard is going to be worth it. Not that the money is actually a big deal, or even, like, a little deal. $25 is nothing, especially spread over a year, and especially taking into account how much more productive I'll hopefully be without spending hours every week just trying to access bookmarks (some of which I actually do need).  </p>

<p>So this'll be the first test. What implementation of Markdown are we using, here? Let's find out.  </p>

<h3>Just a note:</h3>

<p>I'mma go ahead and deploy this now. I'm doing things the old fashioned way (that is, FTP) because IIS is the worst and it makes me sad. I've decided to stick with bashblog for the moment, only because baker is more than I need. So is bashblog, for that matter, but baker also brings along <a href="http://getbootstrap.com">Bootstrap</a> weight, and that's really not something I can see myself needing in blog context. Mostly I write things in Markdown, sometimes peeking in on them with a nifty live preview script to check things; I don't need widgets and animations and such, here.</p>

<p>Anyhow, I'll now begin the long work of cleaning up all these old posts for self-hosting. Thank goodness.</p>

<p>Okay! Here we go.</p>

<h3>BLOGGY BLOGTIME.</h3>

<p>An attempt at this, anyway. <br />
I NEED A BLOGGING ENGINE. <br />
Seriously. I mean, static-site compiler. Whatever. There are so many out there, 
but I can't seem to find one that actually works for me. None of them seem
right.  </p>

<p>I'm literally editing text in a javascript bookmarklet that loads the Ace
editor, right now. Which is annoying a little bit, because it's got syntax 
highlighting and errors based on JS, &amp; obviously I'm writing in Markdown, so...
Oh, and I keep automatically returning when before I hit about 80 characters; 
that's kind of dumb. I need to write a new bookmarklet that pulls in Dillinger
or something.  </p>

<p>Hold on, actually....  </p>

This Here's A Test!
</a></h3>

<p>Well, all right! This is just a little test. I've tried what may well be five or six dozen static site/blog generators over the past few months, and I'm back at two of the ones I tried first--<a href="https://github.com/cfenollosa/bashblog">Bashblog</a> and <a href="https://github.com/taylorchu/baker">Baker</a>. They're both written in bash, and both pretty simple. I dig bashblog's one-file thing, and kind of like the extreme simplicity of the post-editing format, but it's a little sloppy and requires some disassembly to actually configure. Baker's quite a bit easier to work with, and quite a bit more attractive by default, but it's also about three times the size of bashblog. Both of them seem to have Discus/disquszszs/diskust really stuck in there, and I'm not actually in the mood to sign up for yet <em>another</em> social platform, so... we'll have to see about that. OH, and neither one wants to use an alternate implementation of Markdown. not that I mind, there's nothing terribly wrong with the original one from <a href="http://daringfireball.net">John Gruber</a>, but I'd prefer to at least have that option. There are versions in C and Python that I like (and the C is obviously much faster), as well as the various Javascript implementations that are all the rage these days. It'd also be nice to work with some extensions. I'm never sure what's kosher in the original because I rarely use it, but I'm fairly certain I can't do tables and syntax hightlighting here.</p>

<p>ANYWAY. This is just a quick first post, as a test. I'll be doing the same in Baker, and then following up by (gradually) reposting all of my archived blog posts from other platforms, and saved drafts/notes in my Dropbox.</p>

<p>Cheers!</p>
