<p>i don't really like dreaming, i think. lately (for the past few months), it's almost always the same dream that i have. actually it's always a very different dream, but it's always the same reason for the dream. i don't have a lot of really serious attachments, but the few i do have, i <em>really</em> don't want to lose. it scares me, the idea of losing these people, so much so that on the very rare occassion that i do dream, it's always this.</p>

<p>ugh, i kinda hate dreams.</p>

<!-- text begin -->

<p>So, I have a <em>lot</em> of notes that I've taken over the course of the last couple of months. Seeing as they're not doing me a whole lot of good sitting in a pile of Markdown files, I'm gradually going through them, cleaning them up, and I think I'll just post them all as sort of blog posts. Why not? So here's a little list of the topics I'll be covering over the next few weeks:</p>

<ul>
<li>Unicode</li>
<li>SystemJS (and JSPM)</li>
<li>Go</li>
<li>UI</li>
<li>Github Organizations</li>
<li>Functional Reactive Programming (and RxJS)</li>
<li>Elm</li>
<li>Browserify</li>
<li>Bash Builtins</li>
<li>Firebase</li>
<li>ES6</li>
<li>Pusher</li>
<li>Styleguides</li>
<li>Passport (and problems getting errors out of Express)</li>
<li>React (and Webpack)</li>
<li>Isomorphic React</li>
<li>Flux</li>
<li>Meteor</li>
<li>All the reasons I kind of dislike Angular</li>
<li>Bacon.js</li>
<li>Basics of webmastering (which is totally not a word)</li>
<li>Functional programming (in general)</li>
<li>Effective web design</li>
<li>Mongo (and Mongoose, and MongoJS, and Mongolayer)</li>
<li>Ruby, maybe a little bit</li>
<li>Electron (formerly Atom Shell)</li>
<li>NW.js (formerly Node Webkit)</li>
<li>Gulp</li>
<li>Node in general</li>
<li>Probably a good bit of Node stuff, really</li>
<li>I like Node a lot</li>
<li>Maybe a little bit of jQuery?</li>
<li>The developer hiring process</li>
<li>Maybe a little bit of that Javascript language, or something?</li>
<li>Probably not much at all on HTML, because HTML doesn't need... notes... really</li>
<li>CSS... lol, CSS.</li>
<li>People, and the experience of dealing with people on a regular basis</li>
<li>What it's like to live with the people I live with</li>
<li>What it's like to actually find myself liking human beings, and wanting to be around them, especially certain ones, quite a lot. (It's <em>weird!</em>)</li>
</ul>

<p>i don't like being angry. at all. it's not a good look for me. somehow this weekend turned into one just full of anger about a lot of things. some of them aren't a big deal, and i can (eventually) just let everything go, because honestly it's just not worth feeling that shitty about. people aren't worth it, losing friends isn't worth it, losing time and even wasting or losing money... it's just never worth being angry about, because it's not going to change anything, get me back any time or money, fix relationships, or ever somehow make anything better. this is a little different, though, today. bias against persons with mental illness of any type (especially something as common and relatively safe and understood as depression) is <em>not</em> okay, especially when that results in the wrong people going to fucking <em>jail</em>.</p>

<p>You know, I have the strangest dreams. (Good morning/afternoon, incidentally.) My super smart dream interpreter--myself, while in the shower having existential crises and trying to figure everything out--has explained the past several weeks' worth exactly the same way. I don't want to lose people.</p>

<p>dreams are weird. usually i don't remember them. apparently sometimes i do. because i've been going so damn hard lately, when friday or saturday night comes around, i usually sleep for twelve or more hours straight, and i dream. a lot. very vividly. i've had two super intense dreams lately that, for whatever reason, really had a major effect on me for days later.</p>

<p>Jesus fuck it's been an interesting week. I've learned so much this week, and managed to get almost nothing done. <a href="http://npm.im/markvi">Markvi</a> is up to version 0.3.0, because it now actually has the keybinds it was always meant to have. The tentatively titled <em>Whiteboard</em> is stuck in planning, because I kind of stopped caring about it, though I really need to get that one done since it's the main project that actually matters, here. The other project (the thing that has to do with documentation, and making money) is stalled, but I'm so ready to get moving on that because it's super exciting.</p>

<p>I suppose I'll be arriving for all that school business soon enough. Maybe, anyway. I believe our bus is about four hours behind schedule at the moment? Three hours? I tell ya what, Greyhound is a freakin' joke. They'd've gone out of business long ago, if anyone else was running buses to these parts of the country. Our current driver, though, is just about the nicest I've met. Swell guy. We're running a bit behind because of someone who was late arriving from another bus for a transfer... and before that, because of LaWanda (yeah, really) who let us know we were running late and proceeded to take a year and a half to get a move on. And also because some poor dear on this bus got sick. No surprise... this bus (this specific bus, I mean) is filthy, close, claustrophobic... it's not pleasant. Our current driver literally started cleaning it as soon as he got out there, while we were at a rest stop; evidently the Greyhound staff, who've needed to boot us out of the bus every six hours or so to service and clean it, were kind of just not doing a single goddamn thing. (This is pretty evident from the state of the restroom--it has neither improved nor even been masked since I switched to this bus in Pittsburgh, and the fellows in the back who've been on it since New York suggest that it's been like that since they got on.</p>
