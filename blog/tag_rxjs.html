<p>So what with my last computer dying, getting a new phone, trying to find a job, preparing to maybe move,
and all the other nonsense going on, I haven't really blogged at all lately. Oh well.</p>

<p>My to-do list is gigantic, like a whole huge directory tree of several gigabytes full of unfinished stuff.</p>

<p>Somewhere in there, there's rewriting my entire website.</p>

<p>I've just switched from GoDaddy's hosting to my own VPS (a droplet), since GoDaddy's cost was going up by
about 110%. This means I have a LOT more available to me, now. Not quite as much space, but I can run
whatever I need to on my server now, so... I think it's time to finally update everything. I plan on leaving
most things as just plain old static sites (because, let's be honest, no one cares how flashy this crap is
if it takes a year to render it on an old phone). The blog might change a bit, though. I'm still using that
same old script (based originally on <a href="https://github.com/cfenollosa/bashblog">BashBlog</a>, heavily modified
over the past almost-year). Nothing against that script, it does its job and everything, but a 1300-line
shell script to basically turn Markdown into HTML is absurd -- ESPECIALLY since it doesn't include the
parser.</p>

<p>Anyway, here are some notes from the NG-JS meetup a couple of weeks ago. They were lost on my old laptop,
but the SATA-to-USB thingy came in the mail the other day, so I can finally just do something with these.</p>

EVERYTHING IS A STREAM, or Notes On FRP
</a></h3>

<p>IT ALL MAKES SENSE NOW.</p>

<p>Promises are Observables. Promise++, specifically. Note that that means Observables are <em>not</em> Promises/A+ compliant. A Promise would be an Observable with one single emitted value. Our streams return many values.</p>

<p>Listening to streams is Subscribing. We return <em>new</em> streams, hence the term Immutability, which is regarding the original (unchanged, unchangeable) streams.</p>

<p>We do things like mapping, filtering, and scanning. Simple functions applied to streams that return new streams.</p>

<p>A <code>map(f)</code> takes input stream, applies <code>f()</code>, produces value on output stream.</p>

<p>If one creates what we will call a 'metastream' we're basically making a stream of POINTERS. WHY DOES THIS ALL MAKE PERFECT SENSE?!</p>

<p>RxJS has a <code>.flatMap()</code> which is brilliant, it flattens said 'metastream' and emits on a <em>trunk</em> stream everything that would be emitted on the <em>branch</em> streams.</p>

<p>Okay, following the tutorial, I'm going to move these notes over to the actual rx-js/frp directory....</p>

<p>There's a <code>.startWith()</code> that does EXACTLY what it sounds like. No matter the input stream, the output of <code>startWith(x)</code> will have <code>x</code> at the beginning.</p>

<p>It looks to me like everything about FRP makes a lot more sense if graphed/charted first. ASCII can work for this pretty well. Example:</p>

<pre><code>  streamyInput: -1---2---3---45-&gt;
   inputStream: ----a----b--c---&gt;
  dostuffThing: -----X-----X----&gt;
  outputOfThat: ---------E----E-&gt;
streamPostWhat: ----Q---IDK-----&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>Hurray, streams!</p>

<p>In Rx there's a <code>combineLatest()</code> that takes two input streams and joins the two most recently emitted values from both streams, like:</p>

<pre><code>A: ---a-------e----i-------&gt;
B: -----b--c----d------q---&gt;
//////combineLatest(f)//////
-----AB--AC---EC-ED-ID--IQ-&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>Huh. I don't actually know why this isn't working, exactly.</p>

<p>OH WAIT DUH, I forgot jQuery. Thank goodness. I really was hoping I wasn't gonna have dumb problems. YAY THIS IS NICE!</p>
