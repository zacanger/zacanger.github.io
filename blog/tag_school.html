<p>I haven't really mentioned what I'm actually doing here, yet, a whole lot. Well, it should be pretty obvious, but it's mostly cramming as much Javascript into my head as I can possibly handle. THen forgetting some, then relearning it. Lots of that, over and over again, until eventually a good bit starts to stick. For a really large list of the stuff I've been working on, I have some public repos on <a href="https://github.com/zacanger">my Github</a>. The pertinent ones would be the actual <a href="https://github.com/zacanger/devmtn.git">DevMountain assignments and small projects</a>, and the <a href="https://github.com/zacanger/excerpts-and-excersises.git">repo full of extras</a>, things I wanted to learn or messed around with or whatever, since I've been here.</p>

<p>The bigger things are the no-server and personal projects--and in my case, my personal project is (at least conceptually) based on the no-server project (which was, as it sounds, just client-side Angular app.)</p>

<p>Jesus fuck it's been an interesting week.

The tentatively titled <em>Whiteboard</em> is stuck in planning, because I kind of stopped caring about it, though I really need to get that one done since it's the main project that actually matters, here. The other project (the thing that has to do with documentation, and making money) is stalled, but I'm so ready to get moving on that because it's super exciting.</p>

  - Components, just like... everything else these days, so that's totally irrelevant.
  - virtual dom, which is not exactly facebook's anyway.
  - unidirectional data flow, which is a mouthful.
    - that is, the loop.
    - more boilerplate to run that... less boilerplate-replacer built into react?</p>

<p>Look. I don't have anything against Angular on, like, a philosophical level. Or metaphysical. Or personal. I'm just not impressed. An MVC framework that makes templating easier and makes a lot of other things much more complicated? Client-side rendering? Bogging down browsers doing the heavy lifting so servers can respond a little faster? Very cool features. Very innovative. The year is 2008 and Javascript is starting to come into its own. Open source front-end libraries and frameworks are starting to pop up. Github was just founded. Angular is epic, right?</p>

<p>...is fun. Also a pain. But fun.  </p>

<p>I'm 239% sure I'm falling wayyy behind, but I'm also about 72% sure I started with a fairly decent headstart--not first in the cohort, for sure, but maybe around fifth. I think I'll catch up again (hush, I know it's not a race, but I don't want to be lagging) once we start back-end stuff. Maybe. Angular is nice and all, but for whatever reason I just can't seem to focus on it for long. Probably because somewhere deep down in my brain, I just can't bring myself to love the idea of that much client-side work. It feels like one of those really awesome things built by people who've never owned really shitty devices, or even average ones.</p>

<p>Take some concentration. Which, for me, takes a good bit of silence and, like, not needing to think about things other than what I'm trying to focus on. Kind of problematic, here. Silence and uninterrupted stretches of anything kind of don't exist when you're living with three other bachelors, and rooming with the youngest (and most talkative) of them.</p>

<p>Still... it's been a really crazy couple of weeks, and it's only going to get crazier. I suppose I'll be trying to move to a private room (and probably different apartment as well), come the interim... because I'm basically going to need every tiny bit of the break week(s) just to catch up.</p>

asking questions that, while perfectly valid, are generally answered <br />
either in said required reading, or within the first five results <br />

i can't keep doing this, because we're now doing things that i actually <br />
really don't know how to do. losing significant amounts of study time <br />

<p>That's about to start.

She's going to die, and I'm not going to be there to stop it, and it wouldn't matter if I was because nothing would stop her except one specific asshole completely changing everything about himself and being who he must have, at some point, said he was.</p>

<p>So, that's going on. But on the other hand... Javascript is good. Um.</p>

<p>YESH. I'm in Provo, Utah, doing things that will eventually possibly hopefully make me skilled at something. Maybe even enough to get a job in that thing, and pay off the $$$ needed to get said education. Some quick observations:</p>

<ul>
<li>Utah is flat, bare, and bland</li>
<li>Salt Lake City is more like a small town</li>
<li>Provo is not a city by <em>any</em> stretch of the imagination</li>
<li>People here (here at this camp, specifically) are geeks, and really hardcore about it</li>
<li>They actually get excited about things like new features/conveniences in ES6</li>
<li>I'm more behind than I'd like to be, but not as far behind as some folk</li>
<li>The Mac users will never change their ways</li>
<li>I'm going to have a grand time here, I think</li>

<p>I suppose I'll be arriving for all that school business soon enough. Maybe, anyway. I believe our bus is about four hours behind schedule at the moment? Three hours? I tell ya what, Greyhound is a freakin' joke. They'd've gone out of business long ago, if anyone else was running buses to these parts of the country. Our current driver, though, is just about the nicest I've met. Swell guy. We're running a bit behind because of someone who was late arriving from another bus for a transfer... and before that, because of LaWanda (yeah, really) who let us know we were running late and proceeded to take a year and a half to get a move on. And also because some poor dear on this bus got sick. No surprise... this bus (this specific bus, I mean) is filthy, close, claustrophobic... it's not pleasant. Our current driver literally started cleaning it as soon as he got out there, while we were at a rest stop; evidently the Greyhound staff, who've needed to boot us out of the bus every six hours or so to service and clean it, were kind of just not doing a single goddamn thing. (This is pretty evident from the state of the restroom--it has neither improved nor even been masked since I switched to this bus in Pittsburgh, and the fellows in the back who've been on it since New York suggest that it's been like that since they got on.</p>

<p>It's pretty crazy. I'm 99% sure I'm totally not ready, not even a little bit. As I keep saying when people ask, I know I know computers well enough, and I know I can pick things up well enough... I'm just really unfamiliar with Javascript and for some reason it doesn't stick well in my head. That's probably because I don't use it much for fun. It's not the language I'd reach for for most tasks, because (in stark contrast to most of the JS fanpersons on teh Github) I really don't believe it should be the default for a lot of things. Javascript has certainly outgrown the cheesy-animations-in-websites days, but why not use a shell script to do things that a shell script would be best for, and C to do things that should probably be done in C, and leave Javascript for doing things best handled in Javascript? Running a big, clunky, really not all that great engine just to handle using a language almost entirely based around working with the web... for doing stuff in the console? It's cool and all, yeah. I think it's really neat that I could replace most software I use with stuff installed straight from NPM--including the window manager, even. But why would I want to? Cool in theory, I guess, but if I'm using a tiling window manager the most hipster I'll get is Xmonad, and if I need an audio player chances are I'll go with (at most) MOC, not a JS clone of Mplayer.  </p>

<p>I'll need to edit this script a bit more. Needing to delete all the filler text isn't a HUGE deal... if you use a real editor. I mean. It's not a huge deal now, but nano's not exactly... powerful. I could actually just <code>^^</code> start a mark, and then get to where I need to be, and <code>^k</code> cut it... it's the getting aroudn that doesn't work so well. Home and end work sort of as expected, but <code>^Space^</code> and <code>M-Space</code> to go forward/back one word? No, thank you.</p>

<p>Okay, I just wanted to make a note, basically, that I should get http://zcn.gr at some point. Also, in sticking my head back into the whole <a href="http://mickeyswholesalepizza.com">Mickey's</a> project today, I remembered why I don't much like Bootstrap. It's not that it doesn't work, because it does, and it works <strong>very</strong> well, if you use it exactly as intended or have a large enough project to actually need something that complex and... uh... large. But otherwise it's like using a CMS to run a (small, personal) blog. Why do it? Mickey's isn't a big project, and I know it would've been ten times easier to just do it from scratch from the start, but at this point I'm sticking with BS3 because I need to be able to hand the whole thing over to someone else all documented and sort of making sense--and they're going to have lovely task of trying to hunt down, obtain, and beautify some sort of actual content for this thing. (Or, y'know, maybe they'll just not touch it for another ten years and leave up the sort-of-filler with which I'll have to deliver it).</p>

<p>It's not all bad, though. I've learned more on this than I thought I would, specifically in the dealing-with-other-humans area. Mostly, actually, that I'm not very good at it, and that if given a certain amount of leeway, people will take every last second right up until an unbendable deadline to start actually paying attention. (That includes myself; I'm leaving for school in a week, and I'm fairly certain <em>I don't know enough Javascript to do things, like, really at all</em>.)</p>

<p>I suppose I ought to do something about this thing that I've been doing lately where I don't sleep, or sleep maybe four hours a night during the week and then crash for 16 hours on a weekend night/day. That's not healthy, I think. Hmm.</p>
