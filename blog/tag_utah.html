<p>So what with my last computer dying, getting a new phone, trying to find a job, preparing to maybe move,
and all the other nonsense going on, I haven't really blogged at all lately. Oh well.</p>

<p>My to-do list is gigantic, like a whole huge directory tree of several gigabytes full of unfinished stuff.</p>

<p>Somewhere in there, there's rewriting my entire website.</p>

<p>I've just switched from GoDaddy's hosting to my own VPS (a droplet), since GoDaddy's cost was going up by
about 110%. This means I have a LOT more available to me, now. Not quite as much space, but I can run
whatever I need to on my server now, so... I think it's time to finally update everything. I plan on leaving
most things as just plain old static sites (because, let's be honest, no one cares how flashy this crap is
if it takes a year to render it on an old phone). The blog might change a bit, though. I'm still using that
same old script (based originally on <a href="https://github.com/cfenollosa/bashblog">BashBlog</a>, heavily modified
over the past almost-year). Nothing against that script, it does its job and everything, but a 1300-line
shell script to basically turn Markdown into HTML is absurd -- ESPECIALLY since it doesn't include the
parser.</p>

<p>Anyway, here are some notes from the NG-JS meetup a couple of weeks ago. They were lost on my old laptop,
but the SATA-to-USB thingy came in the mail the other day, so I can finally just do something with these.</p>
