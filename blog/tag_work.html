<p>It's pretty crazy. I'm 99% sure I'm totally not ready, not even a little bit. As I keep saying when people ask, I know I know computers well enough, and I know I can pick things up well enough... I'm just really unfamiliar with Javascript and for some reason it doesn't stick well in my head. That's probably because I don't use it much for fun. It's not the language I'd reach for for most tasks, because (in stark contrast to most of the JS fanpersons on teh Github) I really don't believe it should be the default for a lot of things. Javascript has certainly outgrown the cheesy-animations-in-websites days, but why not use a shell script to do things that a shell script would be best for, and C to do things that should probably be done in C, and leave Javascript for doing things best handled in Javascript? Running a big, clunky, really not all that great engine just to handle using a language almost entirely based around working with the web... for doing stuff in the console? It's cool and all, yeah. I think it's really neat that I could replace most software I use with stuff installed straight from NPM--including the window manager, even. But why would I want to? Cool in theory, I guess, but if I'm using a tiling window manager the most hipster I'll get is Xmonad, and if I need an audio player chances are I'll go with (at most) MOC, not a JS clone of Mplayer.  </p>

<p>I'll need to edit this script a bit more. Needing to delete all the filler text isn't a HUGE deal... if you use a real editor. I mean. It's not a huge deal now, but nano's not exactly... powerful. I could actually just <code>^^</code> start a mark, and then get to where I need to be, and <code>^k</code> cut it... it's the getting aroudn that doesn't work so well. Home and end work sort of as expected, but <code>^Space^</code> and <code>M-Space</code> to go forward/back one word? No, thank you.</p>

<p>Okay, I just wanted to make a note, basically, that I should get http://zcn.gr at some point. Also, in sticking my head back into the whole <a href="http://mickeyswholesalepizza.com">Mickey's</a> project today, I remembered why I don't much like Bootstrap. It's not that it doesn't work, because it does, and it works <strong>very</strong> well, if you use it exactly as intended or have a large enough project to actually need something that complex and... uh... large. But otherwise it's like using a CMS to run a (small, personal) blog. Why do it? Mickey's isn't a big project, and I know it would've been ten times easier to just do it from scratch from the start, but at this point I'm sticking with BS3 because I need to be able to hand the whole thing over to someone else all documented and sort of making sense--and they're going to have lovely task of trying to hunt down, obtain, and beautify some sort of actual content for this thing. (Or, y'know, maybe they'll just not touch it for another ten years and leave up the sort-of-filler with which I'll have to deliver it).</p>

<p>It's not all bad, though. I've learned more on this than I thought I would, specifically in the dealing-with-other-humans area. Mostly, actually, that I'm not very good at it, and that if given a certain amount of leeway, people will take every last second right up until an unbendable deadline to start actually paying attention. (That includes myself; I'm leaving for school in a week, and I'm fairly certain <em>I don't know enough Javascript to do things, like, really at all</em>.)</p>

<p>I suppose I ought to do something about this thing that I've been doing lately where I don't sleep, or sleep maybe four hours a night during the week and then crash for 16 hours on a weekend night/day. That's not healthy, I think. Hmm.</p>
