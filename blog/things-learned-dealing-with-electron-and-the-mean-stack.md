things learned dealing with electron and the mean stack

In the interest of [blogging the little things](http://coffeecoder.net/blog/blog-little-things/), I want to write down a couple of things I learned while struggling through [my project](https://github.com/zacanger/ayuba.git). Nothing major, but a few things that I really had to dig to find answers to, buried way underneath unrelated issues in Github and whatnot.

--------

Firstly: Mongo is not an effective way to store data for a desktop app. If you've got to wrap up Mongo into your app, you're looking at a huge binary; if you're calling to Mongolab or whatever, you're looking at an online-only app, which defeats the purpose. Ayuba will be moved to IndexedDB or similar before being rolled back into [markvi](https://www.npmjs.com/package/markvi).

[CodeMirror](http://codemirror.net) and [Ace](http://ace.c9.io/) are both really great, but if they're breaking things, it's okay to just not use them. Syntax highlighting isn't all that important, not for [Markdown](daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/).

Parsers are hard. They're mostly just regular expressions, and that's really exhausting and annoying and not fun. It's a lot more sensible to just use [a really good one](https://github.com/showdownjs/showdown) that already suits your purpose.

[Electron](http://electron.atom.io) is cool, but still new and it still has issues. [NW.js](http://nwjs.io) is a lot more solid, works a lot more intuitively, and is worth learning. Either way, it's a lot easier to just use the [right tools for the job](https://www.python.org/), even if it's not what you're paying money to learn.

CSS is annoying. No one likes CSS. But it's really really really not worth screwing yourself over by using [one of the](http://getbootstrap.com) [popular and really](http://materializecss.com/) [inflexible and overweight](http://yuilibrary.com/) [UI/widgeting/CSS frameworks](https://material.angularjs.org/latest/) out there, because they won't give you any room to breathe later.

Number one important and really frustrating thing I learned, though, was that Electron needs to be told that it can use Angular, jQuery, etc., explicitly. Here's an example of my `app.js` to start my Electron app:


    var app = require('app')
      , BrowserWindow = require('browser-window')
      , mainWindow = null // keep reference of window; otherwise gc will close it!
    
    app.on('window-all-closed', function(){
      if (process.platform != 'darwin') {
        app.quit()  // because osx holds processes open even after
      }             // all windows are closed
    })
    
    // electron's window!
    app.on('ready', function(){
      mainWindow = new BrowserWindow({
        width: 1600
     ,  height: 900
     ,  'accept-first-mouse': true
     ,  'title-bar-style': 'hidden'
     ,  'node-integration': false // otherwise various client-side things break
      })
    
      mainWindow.loadUrl('http://127.0.0.1:4444/admin') // our internal server...
    
      // mainWindow.openDevTools()
    
      mainWindow.on('closed', function(){
        // if we have multiple windows, store them in an array
        // this is where we'd get rid of those
        mainWindow = null
      })
    })


The relevant line is commented, but to emphasize: `'node-integration'` needs to be set to `false` if you want to use frameworks/libraries that might have conflicts with native Node things, like the word `module`. I couldn't find this documented anywhere, and it really threw me off, for about four days straight, until I found an issue raised on Github related to this (link's long lost, now), with the solution to my problem mentioned way down in there somewhere, buried. So, now you know... if your front-end code keeps breaking in Electron, and Electron doesn't need to be aware of your app's Node backend, there's a possible solution for you.

Feel free to check out the [code from my project](https://github.com/zacanger/ayuba/tree/master/the-real-one) and tell me how bad it is. Maybe this'll help someone, at some point.
