## Hi! I'm [Zac Anger](http://zacanger.com).

##### (I promise not to say 'I make things.')

I'm a 20-something guy from the East Coast (Baltimore born, Pennsylvania raised). I've been an [active musician](http://zacanger.bandcamp.com) since childhood, performing and recording in local, regional, and national groups. In recent years I've had the good fortune to work with [Sugo Music Group](http://sugomusic.com), though I have a habit of releasing my music [for free](http://soundcloud.com/zacanger) for a time before sending it off for commercial distribution.

I have a _passion_ for technology. I'm a [FLOSS supporter](http://www.gnu.org/philosophy/floss-and-foss.en.html), [Linux user](https://www.debian.org/), and general web enthusiast. My interests are fairly wide-ranging, from [software minimalism](http://suckless.org) and adherence to the [UNIX philosophy](http://www.faqs.org/docs/artu/ch01s06.html), to [security](https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Main_Page), [browser development](https://github.com/The-Compiler/qutebrowser), [user experience and usability design](http://jxnblk.com/principles/), [development-related humour](https://medium.com/cool-code-pal), [education](http://profiles.devmounta.in/#/student/568f40d14a4f3ace04386674), and sometimes even [straight up code](https://github.com/zacanger).

If it's projects you want, I really suggest heading over to [my Github](https://github.com/zacanger?tab=repositories), my [Devpost profile](http://devpost.com/zacanger), or even my info on [NPM](https://www.npmjs.com/~zacanger). Failing that, I do have one of _[those_](http://linkedin.com/in/zacanger), too.

I keep a brief CV updated in a few formats: [HTML](http://zacanger.com/cv), [Markdown](http://zacanger.com/cv/zacanger.md), [JSON](http:/zacanger.com/cv/zacanger.json), [Python](http://zacanger.com/cv/zacanger.py), and [PDF](http://zacanger.com/cv/zacanger.pdf).

I like to write sometimes, and you can catch that [here](http://zacanger.com/blog), [here](https://notes.pinboard.in/u:zacanger/notes), [here](http://zacanger.tumblr.com/archive/filter-by/text), or even [here](https://www.linkedin.com/today/author/0_2NT0CBae5f1mobjrejBnKk).

Oh, and you can always hit me up, if you want, by [email](mailto:zac@zacanger.com) or [@zacanger](http://twitter.com/zacanger).
