    I'm a Web and Linux enthusiast and musician with a history in front-end
    development and devops. I'm passionate about free and open source
    software, maintain dozens of tools and libraries with hundreds of thousands
    of downloads per month, and have contributed to various projects and
    organizations including Firefox, Webpack, Rancher, Koa, GitHub,
    and Mastodon.

  <p>
    I am comfortable with
    JavaScript (React, Node, Koa, Express, TypeScript),
    CSS (preprocessors, CSS-in-JS),
    CI/CD systems (Circle, Jenkins, TeamCity, GitHub Actions, CloudBuild),
    Docker,
    Kubernetes (Rancher, GKE, EKS),
    Telemetry (EFK, CloudWatch, New Relic, Datadog, Sumo Logic),
    Terraform,
    AWS,
    Linux,
    Shell,
    Git,
    Python,
    Nginx,
    and Vim.
    I would like to spend time learning
    Go,
    Rust,
    Clojure,
    and Haskell.
