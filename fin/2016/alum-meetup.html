    <section class="post-content">
      <p>this was from some reasonably long time ago</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Barbara:</p>
<ul>
<li>Networking events matter.</li>
<li>Barbara from DM2 ended up as the only actual webdev at her company</li>
<li>This kinda means she&#39;s got to be everything from junior dev to PM</li>
<li>Definitely don&#39;t be self-deprecating about stuff.</li>
<li>Express interest outright in companies/their products.</li>
<li>Yeah, sure, don&#39;t talk yourself <em>up</em> too much, but seriously, communicate
well about what you&#39;ve actually managed to do, because they want to know.</li>
<li>Know why it is that a company makes the choices it does. Barbara&#39;s
example: knowing why it was the company she works for uses Angular.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>Mark:</p>
<ul>
<li>Having past projects to talk about <em>really</em> helps. Obviously. Duh.</li>
<li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Situation,_Task,_Action,_Result">STAR</a> is a thing,
and maybe I should actually know what that is, I guess?</li>
<li>This is basically a totally disheartening little talk. What?</li>
<li>They asked him to rewrite his whole project in Scala. I&#39;m confused about what
this guy is actually even talking about. What is this?</li>
<li>His experience is basically one of being put through hell to get in with
some SAAS analytics-analytics company (yes, that&#39;s correct, his company
analyses analytics).</li>
<li>Actual takeaways: go to meetups, network with people, and talk about <em>why</em>
you actually want to be doing this.</li>
<li>Trying out actual interviews (like, with companies where it may or may not
ever happen, but basically you&#39;re not really counting on that working out
anyway) can be a lot more helpful than just going over responses on your own
or in an absolutely-no-pressure kind of situation.</li>
<li>Oh, wait, okay. As depressing as his little bit was, the actual point of it
is this: jump through the hoops, because it&#39;ll probably be worth it. Maybe
the company will pay you for your work on the project (I mean, that&#39;s kinda
becoming normal now, anyway). Maybe they won&#39;t -- and if they don&#39;t, use that
project or whatever on your portfolio.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>Dallin:</p>
<ul>
<li>He likes whatever it is that he does now, I guess.</li>
<li>He has &#39;come to realise more, the many fallacies in his personality.&#39;<ul>
<li>Yay?</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>I don&#39;t know that he has any actual advice. Besides, basically, just kinda
don&#39;t be like him, because he&#39;s more about learning from mistakes than just,
like, maybe, not trying to make as many.</li>
<li>He said a lot of other things but I was too busy being really annoyed with
the damned profiles.devmounta.in project to take any other notes.<ul>
<li>Seriously, it wouldn&#39;t kill people to check pull requests before making
huge commits. I give up.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Dallin learned Ruby in a week between getting hired and actually starting work.
That&#39;s pretty cool. He works mostly in Rails, and I know he does Coffeescript,
so chances are he learned that on the job (knowing Ruby definitely would&#39;ve
helped with that).</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>Jeff:</p>
<ul>
<li>Don&#39;t make portfolio pieces that aren&#39;t accessible.<ul>
<li>Example: his Instagram analytics site.</li>
<li>If this isn&#39;t possible, do a video demo of that project.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
