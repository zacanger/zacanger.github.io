      <p><p>This is an elaboration on a
<a href="https://twitter.com/zacanger/status/796205243474157569">tweet</a> from last night.</p>
<p>I was born male, and I identify as male. That&#39;s pretty convenient for me.
I&#39;m white, which is probably very convenient for me.
I make a conscious effort to be aware of my privilege, but I probably fuck up
sometimes. I hope that whenever that happens, someone will call me out on it.</p>
<p>I was born in Baltimore, and went to a public school that I think was less than
half white. That turned out to be a nice thing, because I never really
understood what the big deal was about skin colour. My parents tell me I
literally didn&#39;t understand that some people might think there was a difference
between people with different coloured skin. And why would I? I was a kid,
that&#39;s not a thing I should have to know.</p>
<p>My family moved to southern Pennsylvania when I was 11. South-Central PA is
overwhemingly white, and has a large boomer population. One could easily go
months at a time without seeing a black person, especially if one was
homeschooled (which I was, because the local schools were some of the worst in
the state).</p>
<p>When I was 19, I was working in the coffee shop in a local grocery store. I had
just voted for the first time. Obama became President. The next morning, I went
to work around 6:30, sold a newspaper to an older guy around 7. He sat down on a
nearby bench and said to me &quot;Can you believe they put a n----- in the White
House?&quot; This wasn&#39;t my first time encountering racism, but it was the first time
I realised just how open people in that area were about it.</p>
<p>I worked at a guitar shop for a while. The guy who owned it was a stereotypical
redneck, something straight out of a Far Side comic. To him, anyone non-white
was nothing but an epithet, women existed to be objectified, and if he got a
hint that someone wasn&#39;t straight, they wouldn&#39;t be allowed in his shop. Most of
his days were spent smoking pot and looking at pictures of girls on the computer
in his office.</p>
<p>I moved to Utah about a year ago. I didn&#39;t intend to stay here, because Utah is
all of the bad things people say about it. It&#39;s also all of the good things
people say about it&mdash;there are mountains and things, and if you&#39;re into
that that&#39;s pretty nice&mdash;but it&#39;s extremely white, extremely Mormon,
extremely dry, and extremely boring. It&#39;s a lot of the things I hated about
Pennsylvania, except drier and with Mormons instead of Evangelicals.</p>
<p>I kind of thought, though, that being out here would be a bit of an escape from
the &#39;culture&#39; in Pennsylvania. James Carville
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pennsyltucky">described PA</a> as being Philadelphia
and Pittsburgh with Alabama in between, and that&#39;s pretty accurate. Utah&#39;s more
like Salt Lake City and then a bunch of nothing mixed with Mormons, which isn&#39;t
actually any better. Mormons are a little more laid-back about their racism and
mysogyny, but it&#39;s still there. They&#39;re just encouraged not to show it off,
because the LDS church doesn&#39;t want that public image. It&#39;s pretty clear based
on their politics, though.</p>
<p>This election was not about anything except for hatred. A common statement is
that Trump just &#39;tells it like it is,&#39; but that&#39;s known to be bullshit. He&#39;s
been the most dishonest Presidential candidate in the history of fact-checking,
and Clinton has been one of the most factually accurate, ever, period. Straight
talk has nothing to do with anything. There have also been numbers that say that
Trump supports think the economy will do better under Trump, but generally folks
actually worried about the economy will vote Democrat, probably because the
economy tends to do better under Democrats.</p>
<p>Trump winning the electoral vote last night has nothing to do with policy. It
was a message from the worst kind of people in this country that they want to be
heard and want to be taken seriously. That they&#39;re afraid of people who don&#39;t
look like them or have the same beliefs as them. People like that old man at the
coffee shop, or Randy from the guitar shop, or Carmine, my boss at my last job
in Pennsylvania. People who think they should have the right to openly
discriminate against other people, people who are so unconcerned with facts that
they sound exactly like characters in Idiocracy (link), calling people &#39;faggot&#39;
for being educated on a topic.</p>
<p>I&#39;m a cis white male, and I&#39;m sorry that a bunch of cis white males did this to
this country. It&#39;s going to be really rough, especially at first when we have a
red house and senate. We, collectively, all the people that have fought for
LGBTQA rights and less discrimination and tried to defend against ignorance and
won Clinton the popular vote, we need to hold on and survive this and support
each other. We need to call each other out on our biases and abuse of
privilege We need to not give up. We need to show each other, the country, and
the world that America is not a country of hate.</p>
<p>There are folks on Twitter saying that this will be easy, that love and
happiness and just get through it, and that&#39;s bullshit. This won&#39;t be easy. This
is serious and dangerous and terrifying. This is bad news all around. But let&#39;s
try, because we can&#39;t all just leave.</p>

    <section class="post-content">
      <p><p>Two things that I think might be fun to play around with, at some point.</p>
<p>First: a less intrusive type annotation thing for JS. It&#39;d be similar to ML or
Haskell style annotations, but maybe use Flow as a sort of backend to actually
do the type checking? It could look something like this:</p>
<pre class="hljs"><code>//<span class="hljs-type-annotation">::</span> <span class="hljs-built_in">Int</span> -&gt; <span class="hljs-built_in">Int</span> -&gt; [<span class="hljs-built_in">Int</span>]
<span class="hljs-keyword">const</span> putIntsInList = (a, b) =&gt; [ a,  b ]

//<span class="hljs-type-annotation">::</span>Str -&gt; Str -&gt; Str // or
//<span class="hljs-type-annotation">::</span>[<span class="hljs-built_in">Char</span>] -&gt; [<span class="hljs-built_in">Char</span>] -&gt; [<span class="hljs-built_in">Char</span>]
<span class="hljs-keyword">const</span> doThingsWithStrings = (a, b) =&gt; <span class="hljs-string"><code>${a} ${b}</code></span></code></pre><p>It could use some sort of regexy thing to basically just detect anywhere there&#39;s
<code>//::</code>, see what the next thing is, and see if they go together. I don&#39;t know
much about ASTs or type systems, though. I just think that&#39;d be a lot less
in-the-way than how TypeScript and Flow currently work. Also, my syntax
highlighting doesn&#39;t know what template strings are, so. That&#39;s gross.</p>
<p>Another thing:</p>
<pre class="hljs"><code><span class="hljs-keyword">import</span> React, { PropTypes } from &#39;react&#39;
<span class="hljs-keyword">import</span> AnotherComponent from &#39;./AnotherComponent&#39;

const <span class="hljs-type">Something</span> = ({ a, b, <span class="hljs-built_in">c</span> }) =&gt; {
  <span class="hljs-keyword">if</span> (!a) <span class="hljs-keyword">return</span> null

  <span class="hljs-keyword">return</span> (
    (div
      (another-component (whatever &#39;a))
        (not (null? b)
          (span (b))
        (not (null? <span class="hljs-built_in">c</span>)
          (<span class="hljs-built_in">map</span> (p (<span class="hljs-built_in">c</span>)))))))
  <span class="hljs-comment">// which would be like</span>
  <span class="hljs-keyword">return</span> (
    &lt;div&gt;
      &lt;<span class="hljs-type">AnotherComponent</span> whatever={a} /&gt;
      {b &amp;&amp; &lt;span&gt;{b}&lt;/span&gt;}
      {<span class="hljs-built_in">c</span> &amp;&amp; <span class="hljs-built_in">c</span>.length &amp;&amp;
        <span class="hljs-built_in">c</span>.<span class="hljs-built_in">map</span>((a, i) =&gt; &lt;p key={i}&gt;{a}&lt;/p&gt;)
      }
    &lt;/div&gt;
  )
}

export <span class="hljs-keyword">default</span> <span class="hljs-type">Something</span></code></pre><p>This a totally made-up syntax for a thing that doesn&#39;t exactly exist, and I
don&#39;t know how useful this would actually be, since there are already great
React libraries for ClojureScript out there. Just think it&#39;d be neat to be able
to to JSX in Scheme. I dunno, just a thought.</p>

      <p><p>Project management tools kill productivity. This isn&#39;t news. They <em>can</em> help
other people be more aware of what you&#39;re doing, which is generally a good thing
(collaborating on projects, managers keeping track of progress, whatever), but
overdoing it with the tools can be seriously detrimental to actually getting
anything done.</p>
<p>I was going to write a much longer post about this, but let me just give you a
list of all things I check several times a day (in the case of Slack, several
times an hour), instead.</p>
<ul>
<li>Wrike (a task/project management thing with the worst UI of any like tool on
the market)</li>
<li>Trello (not so much anymore, but some people still use it at work, apparently)</li>
<li>Quip (a weird combination of Trello and Excel)</li>
<li>Github Issues/PRs (Issues not so much anymore, though that would be the most
sensible place to keep track of repo-specific todos)</li>
<li>And of course, Slack</li>
</ul>
<p>Personally I keep track of what I need to do in two places: for personal items,
a JSON file (yes, a JSON file). This means I can use it with my little
<a href="http://npmjs.com/package/lilnote">command-line note-taking app</a>, easily work
with it in any language, whatever. For work tasks, I just keep a giant Markdown
file, using GFM-style task lists. I end up copying things over from one or more
of the above tools into Markdown, where I keep track of them for hours or days
or weeks, then as things are fleshed out, completed, nixed, or whatever, going
back to those tools (usually more than one) to update them.</p>
<p>This is not an efficient workflow. Some of these tools (Quip and Wrike
especially) are so lacking in all the things that make a good project management
app (mainly, simplicity and ease of use) that using them ends up taking more
than half as much time as many of the small tasks.</p>
<p>The last place I worked, we switched to this thing called Droptask. It was so
bad, such a ridiculously complicated UI mess, that myself and some co-workers
just ended up not using it at all, and relied solely on Slack. Picking a (one,
singular) decent tool really makes a difference. Trello&#39;s popular because it&#39;s
simple and easy. For devs, same goes for Issues.</p>
<p>I meant to write a good bit more about this but I probably don&#39;t need to.
Everyone complains about using too many tools all the time, especially devs
using businessy tools. And it&#39;s late. So.</p>

        <time datetime="2016-10-16">16 October, 2016</time>
         | tags: <a href="/tag/fp/">fp</a>, <a href="/tag/js/">js</a></span>

      <br>

    </header>
    <section class="post-content">
      <p><p>Functional programming is the new hotness these days. It&#39;s also the old hotness.
It&#39;s just pretty hot, really. Everyone wants to have a more functional codebase,
and that&#39;s a good thing. Less side-effecty, easier to hold in your head, etc.;
the benefits of FP have been thoroughly espoused elsewhere. I just have a couple
of things to add about learning functional programming, especially if you&#39;re
coming from another paradigm or a mixed-paradigm language (like JS).</p>
<h2 id="you-probably-don-t-need-to-learn-another-language">You (Probably) Don&#39;t Need To Learn Another Language</h2>
<p>Languages like Haskell are really neat. They&#39;ll change the way you think about
writing code. But you don&#39;t need to learn a classically functional language to
learn functional programming.</p>
<pre class="hljs"><code><span class="hljs-module"><span class="hljs-keyword">module</span> Main <span class="hljs-keyword">where</span></span>
<span class="hljs-import"><span class="hljs-keyword">import</span> System.Environment</span>

<span class="hljs-title">main</span> :: <span class="hljs-type">IO</span> ()
<span class="hljs-title">main</span> = <span class="hljs-keyword">do</span>
  args &lt;- getArgs
  putStrLn (<span class="hljs-string">&quot;Hello &quot;</span> ++ args !! <span class="hljs-number">0</span>)</code></pre><p>If a block of code like that looks pretty foreign, that&#39;s okay. <em>You can program
functionally in whatever language is most familiar to you</em>. Probably. If you&#39;re
a C# dev or Rubyist or something, maybe you should look into something a little
less strictly OO, but if you already write JS (for example), you don&#39;t need to
go learn about abstract algebra and what stuff like <code>Foo :: [Bar] -&gt; Baz Quux</code>
means. Which leads into thought number two:</p>
<h2 id="a-better-type-system-doesn-t-make-a-language-functional">A Better Type System Doesn&#39;t Make A Language Functional</h2>
<p>Yeah, languages like Idris and Haskell and other super mathy things are great
for functional programming, but you don&#39;t <em>need</em> super complex type systems to
program functionally. They&#39;re just, y&#39;know, pretty nice. Look at
<a href="https://racket-lang.org/">Racket</a>, for example. You can have static typing
(with <code>#lang typed/racket</code>) but you don&#39;t <em>have</em> to. Similarly, you can program
functionally just fine in plain old JS, and you can write super imperative code
in TypeScript. My point is, type systems don&#39;t make a language more functional,
they make a language have a different type system.</p>
<h2 id="lots-of-languages-have-a-repl">Lots Of Languages Have A REPL</h2>
<p>LISP people like to talk about their REPL a lot. Same with Haskell folks,
they&#39;ll tell you to go experient in GHCI. That&#39;s great, it really is. The REPL,
for any given language, should be one of the primary tools you use to figure
things out. But most languages have one. If you do Python, you&#39;re probably
familiar with it. Same with Ruby (irb or pry). Node&#39;s REPL, while a little
limited compared to GHCI, is still pretty fantastic. Racket&#39;s is very basic, but
if you <code>(require xrepl)</code> it ends up being very pleasant. Having a decent REPL
isn&#39;t a functional language feature, it&#39;s just a language ecosystem feature.</p>
<h2 id="scheme-is-really-nice">Scheme Is Really Nice</h2>
<p>I&#39;m not a LISPer. I&#39;ve just started learning Racket, which I chose because it&#39;s
very compact compared to, say, ClojureScript (which also looks fantastic, by the
way). But coming primarily from JavaScript, Scheme (Racket is a Scheme) is a
really good way to get into FP in another language. Haskell, ML, Idris, etc.,
are all awesome languages, but Scheme might be a better way to break into
functional languages for a lot of folks. Give it a shot sometime.</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCO1cgjhGzsSYb1rsB4bFe4Q">FunFunFunction</a> is

<p>What we&#39;re going to build this time is going to be a little more complex. We&#39;re
going to write a program that downloads a website and turns it into Markdown for
easy offline reading. This isn&#39;t a new concept, and I actually use a Python script
called <a href="https://github.com/aaronsw/html2text">html2text</a> for this on an
almost-daily basis, but just for fun, we&#39;ll do something similar in Node.</p>
<p>This will also be the first time we&#39;ll be working with external modules, which
is really the most exciting and awesome thing about Node.</p>
<p>Our goal here is to have a small tool we can use like this:</p>
<pre class="hljs"><code>./index<span class="hljs-class">.js</span> zacanger.com</code></pre><p>And it&#39;ll give us back the contents of <code>zacanger.com</code>, in Markdown, ready to
read in the terminal, pipe to an editor, or whatever.</p>
<p>First things first: we&#39;ll need a project. Make a new directory and get into it,
and <code>npm init</code>.</p>
<pre class="hljs"><code><span class="hljs-keyword">mkdir</span> html2txt
<span class="hljs-keyword">cd</span> html2xt
npm init -<span class="hljs-literal">y</span></code></pre><p>The <code>-y</code> flag just means &quot;don&#39;t ask me questions.&quot; You can skip that flag and
fill in the info for your <code>package.json</code> if you&#39;d like, or just go back and edit
it later.</p>
<p>We&#39;re going to be using a couple of things built-in to Node, so we can go ahead
and require them now. We&#39;ll need <code>http</code>&#39;s <code>get</code> method, and also a way to work
with an argument. If you&#39;ve done either of my previous tutorials, you&#39;ll already
be familiar with Node&#39;s <code>process.argv</code>.</p>
<pre class="hljs"><code><span class="hljs-keyword">const</span> { <span class="hljs-keyword">get</span> } = <span class="hljs-built_in">require</span>(<span class="hljs-string">&#39;http&#39;</span>)
<span class="hljs-keyword">const</span> url = process.argv[<span class="hljs-number">2</span>]</code></pre><p>Let&#39;s see if we can&#39;t get some HTML, just as a starting point.</p>
<pre class="hljs"><code>get<span class="hljs-list">(<span class="hljs-keyword">url</span>, res =&gt; {
  res.on<span class="hljs-list">(<span class="hljs-quoted">&#39;data</span>&#39;, d =&gt; {
    console.log<span class="hljs-list">(<span class="hljs-keyword">d</span>)</span>
  })</span>
  res.on<span class="hljs-list">(<span class="hljs-quoted">&#39;end</span>&#39;, <span class="hljs-list">()</span> =&gt; {
    console.log<span class="hljs-list">(<span class="hljs-quoted">&#39;done</span>&#39;)</span>
  })</span>
})</span></code></pre><p>Try that out with something like <code>node index.js http://google.com</code>.</p>
<p>You should see something like <code>&lt;Buffer 3c 21 64 6f 63 74 7</code> (and so on).
<a href="https://nodejs.org/api/buffer.html">Buffers</a> are great and all, but that&#39;s
pretty useless for actual reading. Try calling <code>toString</code> on that data and you
should see some actual HTML (<code>console.log(d.toString())</code>).</p>
<p>(Note: you may see a 301 page here.)</p>
<p>Awesome! We now have all the functionality of prepending <code>view-source:</code> to a URL
in the browser. Let&#39;s do something with that HTML, since it&#39;s probably not how
you prefer to read stuff.</p>
<p>There are a lot of great modules out there for working with Markdown. For this
post, I&#39;ve decided to go with a super simple one without a whole lot of options,
<a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/to-markdown">to-markdown</a>. If you&#39;re not super
familiar with npm, you&#39;re about to learn just about all you need to know to get
started.</p>
<p>In your terminal, <code>npm i -S to-markdown</code>. This is a shorthand for the command
<code>npm install --save to-markdown</code>; most npm commands have shorter versions, and
it can really save you a lot of time if you get used to using them.</p>
<p>You should see a bunch of stuff happen in the terminal. If you check your
<code>package.json</code>, you&#39;ll now see <code>to-markdown</code> in there. It should like something
like this:</p>
<pre class="hljs"><code><span class="hljs-collection">{
  <span class="hljs-string">&quot;name&quot;</span>: <span class="hljs-string">&quot;something&quot;</span>,
  // probably some other stuff
  <span class="hljs-string">&quot;dependencies&quot;</span>: <span class="hljs-collection">{
    <span class="hljs-string">&quot;to-markdown&quot;</span>: <span class="hljs-string">&quot;^3.0.1&quot;</span>
  }</span>
}</span></code></pre><p>(Yes, I know you can&#39;t have comments in JSON.)</p>
<p>Next we&#39;ll need to get that into the program. If you&#39;re using Babel, you can use
<code>import</code>, but to keep things simple we&#39;ll stick with <code>require</code>.</p>
<pre class="hljs"><code>const toMarkdown = <span class="hljs-function"><span class="hljs-title">require</span><span class="hljs-params">(<span class="hljs-string">&#39;to-markdown&#39;</span>)</span></span></code></pre><p>Now try running the HTML through this before logging it out.</p>
<pre class="hljs"><code><span class="hljs-comment">// ...</span>
<span class="hljs-keyword">const</span> toMarkdown = require(&#39;to-markdown&#39;)
<span class="hljs-comment">// ...</span>
  res.<span class="hljs-keyword">on</span>(&#39;data&#39;, <span class="hljs-keyword">d</span> =&gt; {
    console.<span class="hljs-literal">log</span>(toMarkdown(<span class="hljs-keyword">d</span>.<span class="hljs-keyword">toString</span>()))
  })
<span class="hljs-comment">// ...</span></code></pre><p>If you run the script again, you should see beautiful, super-readable Markdown!
All done!</p>
<hr>
<p>Well, mostly. This is nice and all, but there are definitely some things we can
do to make this script a bit better. Firstly, it&#39;s annoying to have to always
type <code>http://</code> before a URL, so maybe we should automatically add that on.</p>
<pre class="hljs"><code><span class="hljs-keyword">const</span> url = process.argv[<span class="hljs-number">2</span>]
<span class="hljs-keyword">const</span> src = url.includes(<span class="hljs-string">&#39;http://&#39;</span> || <span class="hljs-string">&#39;https://&#39;</span>) ? url : `http:<span class="hljs-comment">//${url}`</span></code></pre><p>All this extra bit is doing is checking if the passed in argument aleady has a
scheme, and if it doesn&#39;t, just sticking on on the beginning. If you&#39;re not
familiar with template literals, check out the previous tutorials and the <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Template_literals">docs
on
MDN</a>.</p>
<p>If you&#39;re not familiar with <code>Array.prototype.includes()</code>, it&#39;s basically a
shorthand for <code>.indexOf(foo !== -1)</code>.</p>
<p>Make sure you change the <code>get</code> call to use <code>src</code> instead of <code>url</code>.</p>
<p>And, as in the previous tutorials, we&#39;ll want to just be able to execute this
script, without needing to type in <code>node</code> each time, so add a shebang and make
it exectuable.</p>
<pre class="hljs"><code><span class="hljs-keyword">chmod</span> +<span class="hljs-keyword">x</span> <span class="hljs-keyword">index</span>.js</code></pre><pre class="hljs"><code>#!<span class="hljs-regexp">/usr/</span>bin/env node

<span class="hljs-keyword">const</span> { <span class="hljs-keyword">get</span> } = <span class="hljs-built_in">require</span>(<span class="hljs-string">&#39;http&#39;</span>)
<span class="hljs-comment">// ...</span></code></pre><p>Now you should be able to just do something like <code>./index.js zacanger.com</code> and
see some results.</p>
<p><code>to-markdown</code> can handle take some options. One of them is to use
<a href="https://help.github.com/categories/writing-on-github">GitHub-Flavored
Markdown</a>, which is
pretty nice since that&#39;s probably what most of us are used to using. To enable
this, just pass <code>{ gfm: true }</code> in the call to <code>toMarkdown</code>:</p>
<pre class="hljs"><code><span class="hljs-comment">// ...</span>
<span class="hljs-tag">console</span><span class="hljs-class">.log</span>(<span class="hljs-function">toMarkdown</span>(d.<span class="hljs-function">toString</span>(), { <span class="hljs-attribute">gfm</span>: true }))
<span class="hljs-comment">// ...</span></code></pre><p>You may notice some tags are making it through the conversion (<code>script</code>, <code>span</code>,
<code>div</code>, and probably a few others); I&#39;m not going to go over all of the options
that <code>to-markdown</code> can take, but you should check out the docs and learn how to
write filters, if you&#39;re interested. You could also write your own function to
strip out unwanted elements, and run the Markdown through this:</p>
<pre class="hljs"><code>const cleanOutStuff = <span class="hljs-keyword">string</span> =&gt;
  <span class="hljs-keyword">string</span>.<span class="hljs-built_in">replace</span>(/(<span class="hljs-operator">div</span>|script|span)/g, <span class="hljs-string">&#39;&#39;</span>)

console.<span class="hljs-built_in">log</span>(cleanOutStuff(toMarkdown(d.toString(), { gfm: <span class="hljs-constant">true</span> })))</code></pre><p>But it&#39;d probably be easier to just learn the options rather that spinning
something custom like this.</p>
<p>One thing that really irks me when I&#39;m reading in the terminal is text that
doesn&#39;t wrap. Sometimes I&#39;m on a very large screen, and it can get difficult to
keep track of where I am when the text is too wide. 80 characters is a pretty
reasonable limit, so why don&#39;t we get this text to wrap there? We&#39;re going to
use another module for this:
<a href="https://github.com/substack/node-wordwrap">wordwrap</a>.</p>
<pre class="hljs"><code>npm <span class="hljs-tag">i</span> -S wordwrap</code></pre><pre class="hljs"><code>const wordwrap = <span class="hljs-function"><span class="hljs-title">require</span><span class="hljs-params">(<span class="hljs-string">&#39;wordwrap&#39;</span>)</span></span></code></pre><p>This module needs to know how many characters it can put in a line. We could
just pass it <code>80</code>, but I think maybe we should handle cases where the terminal
is resized very small but maybe won&#39;t stay that way, so we&#39;re going to find out
how big the terminal currently is and base our decision on that.
<code>process.stdout</code> has a way for us to find this out.</p>
<pre class="hljs"><code><span class="hljs-keyword">const</span> wordwrap = require(<span class="hljs-string">&#39;wordwrap&#39;</span>)
<span class="hljs-keyword">const</span> { rows } = process.stdout
<span class="hljs-keyword">const</span> wraplength = (rows &lt; <span class="hljs-number">80</span> ? <span class="hljs-number">80</span> : rows)
<span class="hljs-keyword">const</span> wrapper = wordwrap(wraplength)</code></pre><p>All we&#39;re doing here is wrapping to either the width of the terminal or 80
characters, whichever happens to be greater.</p>
<p>Now we can use that <code>wrapper</code> when we log out the results.</p>
<pre class="hljs"><code><span class="hljs-tag">console</span><span class="hljs-class">.log</span>(<span class="hljs-tag">wrapper</span>(<span class="hljs-tag">toMarkdown</span>(<span class="hljs-tag">d</span><span class="hljs-class">.toString</span>(), <span class="hljs-rules">{ <span class="hljs-rule"><span class="hljs-attribute">gfm</span>:<span class="hljs-value"> true </span></span></span>})))</code></pre><hr>
<p>So, awesome! Your script should now do just about everything you want it to do.
There&#39;s really only one big thing left to do: make it less ugly. That
<code>console.log</code> is really getting gross, don&#39;t you think? I like to handle this by
just defining a bunch of functions I can throw together, so I don&#39;t have to have
all this junk cluttering up my space.</p>
<pre class="hljs"><code>const opts = { gfm: <span class="hljs-constant">true</span> }
const <span class="hljs-built_in">convert</span> = <span class="hljs-operator">a</span> =&gt; toMarkdown(<span class="hljs-operator">a</span>, opts)
const <span class="hljs-operator">wrap</span> = <span class="hljs-operator">a</span> =&gt; wrapper(<span class="hljs-operator">a</span>)
const <span class="hljs-built_in">log</span> = <span class="hljs-operator">a</span> =&gt; console.<span class="hljs-built_in">log</span>(<span class="hljs-operator">a</span>)</code></pre><p>I&#39;m using <code>a</code> as a parameter here. You can use something more descriptive if
you&#39;d like, it really doesn&#39;t matter.</p>
<p>And I think we should also just wait until we have all the data before logging
anything, so let&#39;s adjust our HTTP call (and stick it in a function):</p>
<pre class="hljs"><code>const main = arg =&gt; get<span class="hljs-list">(<span class="hljs-keyword">arg</span>, res =&gt; {
  let b = &#39;&#39; // <code>b</code> for <code>body</code>
  res.on<span class="hljs-list">(<span class="hljs-quoted">&#39;data</span>&#39;, d =&gt; b += d.toString)</span>
  res.on<span class="hljs-list">(<span class="hljs-quoted">&#39;end</span>&#39;, <span class="hljs-list">()</span> =&gt; log<span class="hljs-list">(<span class="hljs-keyword">wrap</span><span class="hljs-list">(<span class="hljs-keyword">convert</span><span class="hljs-list">(<span class="hljs-keyword">b</span>)</span>)</span>)</span>)</span>
})</span></code></pre><p>Your linter might yell at you saying you can&#39;t return assignment. It&#39;s probably
right, but nothing&#39;s going to break. If you&#39;re concerned about it, just wrap
that <code>b += d.toString()</code> in some braces.</p>
<p>Obviously, this is a function, so we need to call it somewhere.</p>
<pre class="hljs"><code><span class="hljs-function"><span class="hljs-title">main</span><span class="hljs-params">(src)</span></span></code></pre><p>We&#39;re just passing it our URL that may or may not have <code>http://</code> stuck on to it.</p>
<hr>
<p>Now you&#39;re really done! I suggest you go check out <code>to-markdown</code>, play around
with <code>process</code>, and see what else you can do with this thing. If you make
something pretty neat, you should consider releasing it! Check out <code>npm help
adduser</code> and <code>npm help publish</code> to see how you could go about this. (There are
probably similar modules out there, though, so make sure you&#39;re not stepping on
anyone&#39;s toes first!)</p>
<p>I&#39;d also suggest you do some basic error handling, but that&#39;s totally up to you.</p>
<p>For the previous two tutorials I waited until the following post to show a
finished version of the script; since this is the last tutorial on writing CLI
apps in Node that I intend to write, the full script is below, as well as my
manifest file (<code>package.json</code>).</p>
<p>Note: I tend to prefer shorter (but hopefully still readable) names for things,
and a somewhat opinionated code style, so the full script below may differ
a bit from your results, and that&#39;s totally fine.</p>
