      <p><h1 id="category-theory-for-js-devs">Category Theory for JS Devs</h1>
<p>Notes taken while watching <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLwuUlC2HlHGe7vmItFmrdBLn6p0AS8ALX">this series</a>.</p>
<h2 id="contracts">Contracts</h2>
<p>Basics of type checking.</p>
<pre class="hljs"><code><span class="hljs-keyword">const</span> str = a =&gt; {
  <span class="hljs-keyword">if</span> (<span class="hljs-keyword">typeof</span> a !== <span class="hljs-string">&#39;string&#39;</span>) <span class="hljs-keyword">throw</span> <span class="hljs-keyword">new</span> <span class="hljs-built_in">TypeError</span>(<span class="hljs-string">&#39;Expected a string&#39;</span>)
  <span class="hljs-keyword">else</span> <span class="hljs-keyword">return</span> a
}</code></pre><h2 id="guarded-functions-and-categories">Guarded Functions and Categories</h2>
<p>Functions that have contracts on input or output are called <em>guarded</em> functions.</p>
<p>An <em>any</em> function might just look like an identity function (<code>const any = a =&gt; a</code>).</p>
<p>Maps between categories are functors.</p>
<p>The <em>objects</em> of categories are the <em>contracts</em>. <em>Morphisms</em> are the (guarded) functions.</p>
<p>Function that returns a contract:</p>
<pre class="hljs"><code><span class="hljs-keyword">const</span> typeOf = type =&gt; a =&gt; {
  <span class="hljs-keyword">if</span> (<span class="hljs-keyword">typeof</span> a !== <span class="hljs-string"><code>&lt;span class=&quot;hljs-subst&quot;&gt;${type}&lt;/span&gt;</code></span>) <span class="hljs-keyword">throw</span> <span class="hljs-keyword">new</span> <span class="hljs-built_in">TypeError</span>(<span class="hljs-string"><code>Expected &lt;span class=&quot;hljs-subst&quot;&gt;${type}&lt;/span&gt;!</code></span>)
  <span class="hljs-keyword">else</span> <span class="hljs-keyword">return</span> a
}</code></pre><p>And basic usage:</p>
<pre class="hljs"><code>const bool = <span class="hljs-function"><span class="hljs-title">typeOf</span><span class="hljs-params">(<span class="hljs-string">&#39;boolean&#39;</span>)</span></span>
const num  = <span class="hljs-function"><span class="hljs-title">typeOf</span><span class="hljs-params">(<span class="hljs-string">&#39;number&#39;</span>)</span></span>
<span class="hljs-comment">// etc.</span>
<span class="hljs-comment">// Obviously, for arrays you&#39;d need to use Array.isArray()</span></code></pre><p>Then we could do something like</p>
<pre class="hljs"><code>const increment = <span class="hljs-operator">a</span> =&gt; {
  <span class="hljs-operator">a</span> = <span class="hljs-built_in">num</span>(<span class="hljs-operator">a</span>)
  <span class="hljs-constant">return</span> <span class="hljs-operator">a</span> + <span class="hljs-number">1</span>
}</code></pre><p>Before I go further I should mention that yes, I have heard of Flow and TypeScript.</p>
<pre class="hljs"><code>const increment = (<span class="hljs-tag">a</span>: number) =&gt; <span class="hljs-tag">a</span> + <span class="hljs-number">1</span></code></pre><p>I assume this video series will get to actual type systems at some point, though
it was made before TypeScript and Flow were written, so it won&#39;t be mentioning those.</p>
<h2 id="array-contracts">Array Contracts</h2>
<p>Not using <code>isArray</code> or <code>instance of</code>. Using <code>toString</code>.</p>
<pre class="hljs"><code><span class="hljs-keyword">const</span> arr = a =&gt; {
  <span class="hljs-keyword">if</span> ({}.toString.call(a) !== <span class="hljs-string">&#39;[object Array]&#39;</span>) <span class="hljs-keyword">throw</span> TypeError(<span class="hljs-string">&#39;Expected array!&#39;</span>)
  <span class="hljs-keyword">else</span> <span class="hljs-keyword">return</span> a
}</code></pre><p>The same thing could be done for <code>Date</code>, <code>RegExp</code>, etc.</p>
<h2 id="functors">Functors</h2>
<p>Takes a maps the contract over the things array. Will throw if they&#39;re not all
correct. Ensure that your array is, for example, all Strings, or whatever.</p>
<pre class="hljs"><code>const arrayOf = contract =&gt; things =&gt; <span class="hljs-function"><span class="hljs-title">arr</span><span class="hljs-params">(things)</span></span>.<span class="hljs-function"><span class="hljs-title">map</span><span class="hljs-params">(c)</span></span></code></pre><p>This acts on the category&#39;s <em>objects</em> and <em>morphisms</em> both, and produces new
objects and new morphisms.</p>
<h2 id="maybe">Maybe</h2>
<p>The <em>Maybe</em> functor.</p>
<p><code>Maybe</code> is a Monad, but I guess we&#39;re only thinking of its Functor-ness for this
video?</p>
<p>Anyway here&#39;s some code.</p>
<pre class="hljs"><code><span class="hljs-keyword">const</span> Maybe = () =&gt; {}

    <section class="post-content">
      <p><p>So, I went to one of those code bootcamps. I started there just over a year ago,
and when I finished the course I worked there as a mentor for a cohort (three
months). Immediately after that, I got what I think is a pretty swell job doing
development full time, working mostly in technologies that I really like.</p>
<p>It&#39;s hard to find non-success stories from bootcamps, since generally the people
who go to these things are people who are really determined to do very well. You
don&#39;t go and pay $10k-$20k to lock yourself up in a building with a bunch of
other nerds for twelve or moure hours every day for three months straight unless
you really want to get something out of it. I think I&#39;m a good example of
someone who did really well through a bootcamp, though, and the reason I did so
well comes down to really just one thing, which I think everyone going into
computing (whether it&#39;s web development, databases, hardware, whatever) really
should be aware of.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>KNOW COMPUTERS</p>
</blockquote>
<p>That seems really obvious, right? But as a mentor it was amazing to me how many
people would come into a course that&#39;s just about making things happen with
computers, not knowing a lot of the basics of how to <em>use</em> a computer, and
knowing virtually nothing about how computers actually <em>work</em>. They&#39;re not just
a thing with a keyboard and a screen and a logo on the back. They&#39;re not just a
status symbol, though Mac users would like you to think they are. They&#39;re not
magical, and it&#39;s important to know what they do and how they do it, at least in
vague terms.</p>
<p>No junior web dev should really be expected to be familiar with what a page
cache is, or maybe even how domain names are resolved, but you should at least
know what a kernel is, what userland actually means, what the implications of
using your particular filesystem are, what the internet infrastructure kind of
looks like (at least in vague terms), and how to do some basic things that will
save you a lot of time later on (general terminal usage is a good place to
start).</p>
<p>This is the number one thing that can help you get, and stay, ahead as a student
and junior dev, in my opinion. And it&#39;s stuff you&#39;ll absolutely <em>have</em> to know
at some point, and probably mostly won&#39;t be taught, so it&#39;s a good idea to just
pick up this stuff as early as possible.</p>

      <p><p>This is an elaboration on a
<a href="https://twitter.com/zacanger/status/796205243474157569">tweet</a> from last night.</p>
<p>I was born male, and I identify as male. That&#39;s pretty convenient for me.
I&#39;m white, which is probably very convenient for me.
I make a conscious effort to be aware of my privilege, but I probably fuck up
sometimes. I hope that whenever that happens, someone will call me out on it.</p>
<p>I was born in Baltimore, and went to a public school that I think was less than
half white. That turned out to be a nice thing, because I never really
understood what the big deal was about skin colour. My parents tell me I
literally didn&#39;t understand that some people might think there was a difference
between people with different coloured skin. And why would I? I was a kid,
that&#39;s not a thing I should have to know.</p>
<p>My family moved to southern Pennsylvania when I was 11. South-Central PA is
overwhemingly white, and has a large boomer population. One could easily go
months at a time without seeing a black person, especially if one was
homeschooled (which I was, because the local schools were some of the worst in
the state).</p>
<p>When I was 19, I was working in the coffee shop in a local grocery store. I had
just voted for the first time. Obama became President. The next morning, I went
to work around 6:30, sold a newspaper to an older guy around 7. He sat down on a
nearby bench and said to me &quot;Can you believe they put a n----- in the White
House?&quot; This wasn&#39;t my first time encountering racism, but it was the first time
I realised just how open people in that area were about it.</p>
<p>I worked at a guitar shop for a while. The guy who owned it was a stereotypical
redneck, something straight out of a Far Side comic. To him, anyone non-white
was nothing but an epithet, women existed to be objectified, and if he got a
hint that someone wasn&#39;t straight, they wouldn&#39;t be allowed in his shop. Most of
his days were spent smoking pot and looking at pictures of girls on the computer
in his office.</p>
<p>I moved to Utah about a year ago. I didn&#39;t intend to stay here, because Utah is
all of the bad things people say about it. It&#39;s also all of the good things
people say about it&mdash;there are mountains and things, and if you&#39;re into
that that&#39;s pretty nice&mdash;but it&#39;s extremely white, extremely Mormon,
extremely dry, and extremely boring. It&#39;s a lot of the things I hated about
Pennsylvania, except drier and with Mormons instead of Evangelicals.</p>
<p>I kind of thought, though, that being out here would be a bit of an escape from
the &#39;culture&#39; in Pennsylvania. James Carville
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pennsyltucky">described PA</a> as being Philadelphia
and Pittsburgh with Alabama in between, and that&#39;s pretty accurate. Utah&#39;s more
like Salt Lake City and then a bunch of nothing mixed with Mormons, which isn&#39;t
actually any better. Mormons are a little more laid-back about their racism and
mysogyny, but it&#39;s still there. They&#39;re just encouraged not to show it off,
because the LDS church doesn&#39;t want that public image. It&#39;s pretty clear based
on their politics, though.</p>
<p>This election was not about anything except for hatred. A common statement is
that Trump just &#39;tells it like it is,&#39; but that&#39;s known to be bullshit. He&#39;s
been the most dishonest Presidential candidate in the history of fact-checking,
and Clinton has been one of the most factually accurate, ever, period. Straight
talk has nothing to do with anything. There have also been numbers that say that
Trump supports think the economy will do better under Trump, but generally folks
actually worried about the economy will vote Democrat, probably because the
economy tends to do better under Democrats.</p>
<p>Trump winning the electoral vote last night has nothing to do with policy. It
was a message from the worst kind of people in this country that they want to be
heard and want to be taken seriously. That they&#39;re afraid of people who don&#39;t
look like them or have the same beliefs as them. People like that old man at the
coffee shop, or Randy from the guitar shop, or Carmine, my boss at my last job
in Pennsylvania. People who think they should have the right to openly
discriminate against other people, people who are so unconcerned with facts that
they sound exactly like characters in Idiocracy (link), calling people &#39;faggot&#39;
for being educated on a topic.</p>
<p>I&#39;m a cis white male, and I&#39;m sorry that a bunch of cis white males did this to
this country. It&#39;s going to be really rough, especially at first when we have a
red house and senate. We, collectively, all the people that have fought for
LGBTQA rights and less discrimination and tried to defend against ignorance and
won Clinton the popular vote, we need to hold on and survive this and support
each other. We need to call each other out on our biases and abuse of
privilege We need to not give up. We need to show each other, the country, and
the world that America is not a country of hate.</p>
<p>There are folks on Twitter saying that this will be easy, that love and
happiness and just get through it, and that&#39;s bullshit. This won&#39;t be easy. This
is serious and dangerous and terrifying. This is bad news all around. But let&#39;s
try, because we can&#39;t all just leave.</p>

    <section class="post-content">
      <p><p>Two things that I think might be fun to play around with, at some point.</p>
<p>First: a less intrusive type annotation thing for JS. It&#39;d be similar to ML or
Haskell style annotations, but maybe use Flow as a sort of backend to actually
do the type checking? It could look something like this:</p>
<pre class="hljs"><code>//<span class="hljs-type-annotation">::</span> <span class="hljs-built_in">Int</span> -&gt; <span class="hljs-built_in">Int</span> -&gt; [<span class="hljs-built_in">Int</span>]
<span class="hljs-keyword">const</span> putIntsInList = (a, b) =&gt; [ a,  b ]

//<span class="hljs-type-annotation">::</span>Str -&gt; Str -&gt; Str // or
//<span class="hljs-type-annotation">::</span>[<span class="hljs-built_in">Char</span>] -&gt; [<span class="hljs-built_in">Char</span>] -&gt; [<span class="hljs-built_in">Char</span>]
<span class="hljs-keyword">const</span> doThingsWithStrings = (a, b) =&gt; <span class="hljs-string"><code>${a} ${b}</code></span></code></pre><p>It could use some sort of regexy thing to basically just detect anywhere there&#39;s
<code>//::</code>, see what the next thing is, and see if they go together. I don&#39;t know
much about ASTs or type systems, though. I just think that&#39;d be a lot less
in-the-way than how TypeScript and Flow currently work. Also, my syntax
highlighting doesn&#39;t know what template strings are, so. That&#39;s gross.</p>
<p>Another thing:</p>
<pre class="hljs"><code><span class="hljs-keyword">import</span> React, { PropTypes } from &#39;react&#39;
<span class="hljs-keyword">import</span> AnotherComponent from &#39;./AnotherComponent&#39;

const <span class="hljs-type">Something</span> = ({ a, b, <span class="hljs-built_in">c</span> }) =&gt; {
  <span class="hljs-keyword">if</span> (!a) <span class="hljs-keyword">return</span> null

  <span class="hljs-keyword">return</span> (
    (div
      (another-component (whatever &#39;a))
        (not (null? b)
          (span (b))
        (not (null? <span class="hljs-built_in">c</span>)
          (<span class="hljs-built_in">map</span> (p (<span class="hljs-built_in">c</span>)))))))
  <span class="hljs-comment">// which would be like</span>
  <span class="hljs-keyword">return</span> (

      <p><p>Project management tools kill productivity. This isn&#39;t news. They <em>can</em> help
other people be more aware of what you&#39;re doing, which is generally a good thing
(collaborating on projects, managers keeping track of progress, whatever), but
overdoing it with the tools can be seriously detrimental to actually getting
anything done.</p>
<p>I was going to write a much longer post about this, but let me just give you a
list of all things I check several times a day (in the case of Slack, several
times an hour), instead.</p>
<ul>
<li>Wrike (a task/project management thing with the worst UI of any like tool on
the market)</li>
<li>Trello (not so much anymore, but some people still use it at work, apparently)</li>
<li>Quip (a weird combination of Trello and Excel)</li>
<li>Github Issues/PRs (Issues not so much anymore, though that would be the most
sensible place to keep track of repo-specific todos)</li>
<li>And of course, Slack</li>
</ul>
<p>Personally I keep track of what I need to do in two places: for personal items,
a JSON file (yes, a JSON file). This means I can use it with my little
<a href="http://npmjs.com/package/lilnote">command-line note-taking app</a>, easily work
with it in any language, whatever. For work tasks, I just keep a giant Markdown
file, using GFM-style task lists. I end up copying things over from one or more
of the above tools into Markdown, where I keep track of them for hours or days
or weeks, then as things are fleshed out, completed, nixed, or whatever, going
back to those tools (usually more than one) to update them.</p>
<p>This is not an efficient workflow. Some of these tools (Quip and Wrike
especially) are so lacking in all the things that make a good project management
app (mainly, simplicity and ease of use) that using them ends up taking more
than half as much time as many of the small tasks.</p>
<p>The last place I worked, we switched to this thing called Droptask. It was so
bad, such a ridiculously complicated UI mess, that myself and some co-workers
just ended up not using it at all, and relied solely on Slack. Picking a (one,
singular) decent tool really makes a difference. Trello&#39;s popular because it&#39;s
simple and easy. For devs, same goes for Issues.</p>
<p>I meant to write a good bit more about this but I probably don&#39;t need to.
Everyone complains about using too many tools all the time, especially devs
using businessy tools. And it&#39;s late. So.</p>
