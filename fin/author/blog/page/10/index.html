      <p><p>think in terms of positives, not negatives</p>
<p>for example &#39;ishidden(true)&#39; is confusing.
instead to &#39;isvisible&#39;.</p>
<p>think about ng-show/hide ng-disabled what? this is confusing.</p>
<p>instead of this, think in terms of enabled/showing</p>
<p>this is both for myself (because i get confused) and for other people</p>
<p>evidently it&#39;s not always clear especially to non-native english speakers what the hell is going on</p>
<p>example from ariya hidayat&#39;s blog:
if you asked him if <code>A</code> equals <code>a</code> if <code>caseInsensitive</code> is <code>false</code>, that&#39;d
take a minute of thinking to even understand. instead, why not just <code>caseSensitive</code>?</p>

      <p><p>fetch is a thing</p>
<p>uses promises</p>
<p>here&#39;s doing stuff with xhr:</p>
<pre class="hljs"><code><span class="hljs-keyword">var</span> xhr = <span class="hljs-keyword">new</span> XMLHttpRequest()
xhr.open(<span class="hljs-string">&#39;GET&#39;</span>, url)
xhr.responseType = <span class="hljs-string">&#39;json&#39;</span>

xhr.onload = <span class="hljs-function"><span class="hljs-keyword">function</span>(<span class="hljs-params"></span>)</span>{
  <span class="hljs-comment">// do stuff with xhr.response</span>
}

xhr.onerror = <span class="hljs-function"><span class="hljs-keyword">function</span>(<span class="hljs-params"></span>)</span>{
  <span class="hljs-built_in">console</span>.error(<span class="hljs-string">&#39;crap&#39;</span>)
}

xhr.send()</code></pre><p>and the equivalent with fetch:</p>
<pre class="hljs"><code><span class="hljs-function"><span class="hljs-title">fetch</span><span class="hljs-params">(url)</span></span>
.<span class="hljs-function"><span class="hljs-title">then</span><span class="hljs-params">(res =&gt; res.json()</span></span>)
.<span class="hljs-function"><span class="hljs-title">then</span><span class="hljs-params">(data =&gt; /<em> do stuff with data </em>/)</span></span>
.<span class="hljs-function"><span class="hljs-title">catch</span><span class="hljs-params">(e =&gt; console.error(e)</span></span>)</code></pre><p>granted i&#39;m also using es2015 in the fetch example, which makes it even nicer-looking,
but whatever.</p>
<p>using esnext async functions:</p>
<pre class="hljs"><code><span class="hljs-list">(<span class="hljs-keyword">async</span><span class="hljs-list">()</span> =&gt; <span class="hljs-collection">{
  try <span class="hljs-collection">{
    let res = await fetch<span class="hljs-list">(<span class="hljs-keyword">url</span>)</span>
    let data = awat res.json<span class="hljs-list">()</span>
    // do stuff with data
  }</span> catch<span class="hljs-list">(<span class="hljs-keyword">e</span>)</span> <span class="hljs-collection">{
    console.error<span class="hljs-list">(<span class="hljs-keyword">e</span>)</span>
  }</span>
}</span>)</span><span class="hljs-list">()</span></code></pre><p>xhr is kinda gross. i mean, everyone&#39;s used to it, and it basically works, but... yech.</p>
<p>fetch is basically complete i think? i mean, evidently it&#39;s even in safari&#39;s dev preview version.</p>
<p>if it&#39;s made it to safari, it&#39;s probably safe to use.</p>
<p>fetch keeps req and res separate (they&#39;re constructors).</p>
<p>request.context lets you tell where the req actually came from (eg link vs loaded asset vs whatever).</p>
<p>you can throw a <code>no-cors</code> in your request so stuff doesn&#39;t fail (like it would with XHR) without CORS headers.</p>
<pre class="hljs"><code><span class="hljs-function"><span class="hljs-title">fetch</span><span class="hljs-params">(<span class="hljs-string">&#39;//foo.com&#39;</span>, {mode : <span class="hljs-string">&#39;no-cors&#39;</span>})</span></span>.<span class="hljs-function"><span class="hljs-title">then</span><span class="hljs-params">(response =&gt; console.log(response.type)</span></span>) <span class="hljs-comment">// opaque</span></code></pre><p>can&#39;t actually read the content of response here, but it could be used by something else (add an event listener
for when it comes back, for example).</p>
<p>other modes: <code>same-origin</code>, <code>cors</code>, and <code>cors-with-forced-preflight</code>.</p>
<p>you could also cache that stuff, which is nice.</p>
<p>xhr buffers the entire response into memory. with fetch you can access the stream. actually with XHR you can access
it sort of, with <code>responseText</code> while it&#39;s still going on, but it&#39;s going to put it all in mem anyway.</p>
<pre class="hljs"><code>fetch(url)
.then(response =&gt; {
  <span class="hljs-keyword">let</span> foo = &#39;some <span class="hljs-type">string</span>, <span class="hljs-keyword">for</span> example&#39;
  <span class="hljs-keyword">let</span> reader = response.body.getReader()
  reader.read().then(<span class="hljs-literal">result</span>) =&gt; {
    // okay there&#39;s actually a little more to this, but the idea <span class="hljs-keyword">is</span>,
    // we can have an <span class="hljs-keyword">if</span> <span class="hljs-keyword">in</span> here to check <span class="hljs-keyword">if</span> this bit <span class="hljs-keyword">of</span> the stream
    // <span class="hljs-keyword">is</span> equal to the thing we want. <span class="hljs-keyword">and</span> then, say
    reader.cancel(&#39;i guess we\&#39;re done, here&#39;)
  }
})
.then(<span class="hljs-literal">result</span> =&gt; /<em> <span class="hljs-keyword">do</span> stuff </em>/)
.catch(e =&gt; console.error(e))</code></pre><p><code>response.body</code> is a <code>ReadableStream</code>.</p>
<p>How cool is this? Think about it. You have a stream of data from somewhere. You can generate
content on the go, using that, with fetch. You can feed that to the view as you get it.</p>
<p>I guess fetch didn&#39;t have streams when it first started to be implemented, so they have some
other readers they stuck in there. So, <code>response</code> (or <code>request</code> actually, too), then</p>
<ul>
<li><code>.arrayBuffer()</code></li>
<li><code>.blob()</code></li>
<li><code>.formData()</code></li>
<li><code>.json()</code></li>
<li>and <code>.text()</code></li>
</ul>
<p>Once they&#39;ve been called, you can&#39;t call another one on that same stream (they &#39;drain&#39; the stream). What we could
do instead is <code>.clone()</code>: <code>fetch(url).then(response =&gt; respone.clone().json().catch() =&gt; response.text())</code>.</p>
<p>You can check <code>response.headers</code> to decide what you need to do with it.</p>
<pre class="hljs"><code>fetch(url)
.<span class="hljs-keyword">then</span>(response =&gt; {
  <span class="hljs-keyword">if</span> (response.headers.<span class="hljs-built_in">get</span>(<span class="hljs-string">&#39;Content-Type&#39;</span>) === <span class="hljs-string">&#39;application/json&#39;</span>) {
    <span class="hljs-constant">return</span> response.json()
  }
  <span class="hljs-constant">return</span> response.<span class="hljs-keyword">text</span>()
})</code></pre><p><code>headers</code> can be used for reading and writing, has <code>Headers.prototype[Symbol.iterator]</code>. You get better
control over cache, and same-origin requests without credentials (no credentials is fetch&#39;s default).</p>
<p>You <em>can&#39;t</em> abort a request with fetch before at least the headers come back (yet).</p>
<p>You can&#39;t track progress (yet), but you can do stuff to do that on your own (by working with <code>Content-Length</code>).</p>
<p>Sync is in the spec, but doesn&#39;t look like anyone will implement that in the API.</p>
<p>Oh right, thre are other verbs here. Or just POST?</p>
<pre class="hljs"><code>fetch(url, {
  <span class="hljs-keyword">method</span>  : &#39;post&#39;
, headers : {&#39;<span class="hljs-type">Content</span>-<span class="hljs-type">Type</span>&#39; : &#39;application/x-www-form-urlencoded; charset=<span class="hljs-type">UTF</span>-<span class="hljs-number">8</span>&#39;}
, body    : &#39;stuff=things&amp;hello=world&#39;
})
.then(/<em> etc. </em>/)</code></pre><p>And credentials (like cookies, for example): <code>fetch(url, {credentials : &#39;include&#39;})</code></p>
<p>There&#39;s a node module called <code>fetch-it</code> which is basically like (and is based on <code>axios</code>), but using fetch
instead of XHR. Looks pretty nice.</p>
<p>There are a bunch of other fetch implementations. But it&#39;s already basically in browsers, so Node can&#39;t be
<em>too</em> far behind... right?</p>

<li>analyzing the efficiency of algorithms (or code).</li>
<li>One could figure how much time fn will take given n input(s).</li>

(eg 100ms vs 10000ms, not 100ms vs 110ms).</li>

<span class="hljs-comment">// <code>O(log n)</code> is a good. recursion, for example, can be helpful here.</span>
<span class="hljs-comment">// this is tough to understand without having any real background in math</span>
<span class="hljs-comment">// i think what this mens is, so, <code>log n</code> means something like, what you&#39;d need</span>

<span class="hljs-comment">// ... sort of? whatever, not gonna stress about it too much right this minute.</span></code></pre><h2 id="sorts">Sorts</h2>
<ul>
<li>A bubble sort is <code>O(n2)</code>, because there are two loops:<ul>
<li>One to check if the indices of two elements ought to be swapped, and</li>
<li>An outer loop to see if the swap took place</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>An insertion sort is slightly better.<ul>
<li>It&#39;d be useful if you&#39;re reasonably confident that what you&#39;re sorting is already
somewhat close to being sorted.</li>
<li>This could be anywhere from <code>O(n2)</code> to <code>O(n)</code>.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Merge sort is recursive.<ul>
<li>The way this works is to take your list, split it, and then call itself (the sort)
on each half.</li>
<li>Then that repeats for each smaller bit. Once the list gets down to one, that&#39;s returned.</li>
<li>Then I guess you&#39;d have another merge going on that&#39;s going over each pair (or set?) of
lists and merging that, and then on back up, until it&#39;s done.</li>
<li><code>Array.sort()</code> is usually a merge sort.</li>
<li>A merge sort will also keep equivalent elements at their original indicies.<ul>
<li>Apparenty we call that being <em>stable</em>.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><code>O(n log n)</code>. Wat.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Quicksort is also recursive.<ul>
<li>It&#39;s the other one some engines use for <code>Array.prototype.sort</code>.</li>
<li>Take the last el, and call it your pivot.<ul>
<li>Everything smaller goes to the &#39;left&#39; of that, everything larger to the right.</li>
<li>Then the same sort is called on each half.</li>
<li>Each returns, and then the left, pivot, and right are catenated (in that order).</li>
<li>When you get to a list of one or zero, it just returns.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>This is also <code>O(n log n)</code>.<ul>
<li>Uses less memory than a merge sort (doesn&#39;t have to create new lists all over the place).</li>
<li>Performs like crap on an already-sorted list, since it&#39;d be starting with a pivot of the
largest element, already.<ul>
<li>You can get around that by doing stuff like checking the 0, length -1, and in the middle,
and swapping if need be to get a better pivot.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="data-structures">Data Structures</h2>
<h3 id="interfaces">Interfaces</h3>
<ul>
<li>Interfaces?<ul>
<li>Meaning, we just want to consume that data structure.</li>
<li>We don&#39;t need to know how it works, just that it acts some specific, expected way.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Sets are nice. We have these in ES6 now.<ul>
<li>Sets will always at least let you:<ul>
<li><strong>add</strong> items,</li>
<li>check if the set <strong>contains</strong> them,</li>
<li><strong>remove</strong> items,</li>
<li>and call <strong>toList</strong> (or similar; JS sets have <code>.values()</code> but for an Array you&#39;d want to do
something like <code>const arr = Array.from(someSet)</code> or <code>const arr = [...someSet]</code>.<ul>
<li>This won&#39;t come back in any particular order -- sets don&#39;t keep track of that.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>What I can really see useful about them is that they don&#39;t allow duplicate values.<ul>
<li>If you do something like <code>const s = new Set ; s.add(&#39;foo&#39;) ; s.add(&#39;foo&#39;)</code> it won&#39;t yell at you,
but if you then do <code>s.values()</code> you&#39;ll just see <code>SetIterator { &#39;foo&#39; }</code>.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Maps are basically the same sort of concept as a hash/dictionary/JS object, except without all the
extra bits that JS objects have (methods, inheritance, etc.).<ul>
<li>Basically just a collection of key-value pairs, except:<ul>
<li>Really more like a <em>set</em> of keys, with values associated with them, so</li>
<li>Again, no duplicates!</li>
<li>You could have duplicate <em>values</em> though. Just not duplicate keys.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Stacks are kinda like what they sound like.<ul>
<li>Only <code>push</code> and <code>pop</code> type of things.</li>
<li>LIFO</li>
<li>So if you have a stack that&#39;s like <code>a b c</code> and you push <code>d</code>, then pop, you&#39;ll get <code>d</code> returned
(and removed from the stack).</li>
<li>Frequently have a &#39;peek&#39;-like method for looking at the top of the stack without actualy doing
anything.</li>
<li>Easiest way to visualize this is probably just thinking about the order of execution of something
trivial, like a function that calls two functions, one of which maybe calls another funciton or two.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Queues are FIFO.<ul>
<li>These would have methods like <code>enqueue</code> (push) and <code>dequeue</code> (pop), and probably a &#39;peek&#39; type of
thing too.</li>
<li>With priority queues, things that have a higher priority can be sort of rushed through the line,
basically, and dequeued earlier.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="implementations">Implementations</h3>
<ul>
<li>An ArrayList (it&#39;s a Java thing, I guess -- JS has arrays, and we don&#39;t really need to think all that
much about how they actually do their job because we have GC--wait, does Java not? Oh. Huh. Poor them.)
addresses specific indices like normal, but when you remove items from the array, you have to, like,
shrink it back down because you have to think about that bit of memory.<ul>
<li>So I guess, say you do the equivalent of <code>.splice()</code> or something, you have to actually say &#39;okay, get rid of element [2], then move everything from [3] to the end back one, then get rid of the last one, please&#39; or something.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>So, I hear a lot about linked lists. Apparently they&#39;re super important because it&#39;s one of like three
things any CS grad knows. Almost definitely in Java.<ul>
<li>A linked list is just a list where each element is aware of the next element.</li>
<li>So basically it&#39;s a list where each item has two properties:<ul>
<li>Its actual value, and</li>
<li>A pointer (or reference) to the next node (element)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>A linked list&#39;s <code>add</code> and <code>remove</code> would be <code>O(1)</code>, then, because all you need to do is change the
pointer on the previous node.<ul>
<li>Its <code>get</code> would be <code>O(n)</code> though because you need to loop through up &#39;til you get to the right node.</li>
<li>The ArrayList would be the other way around, it&#39;d have a <code>delete</code> and <code>add</code> of <code>O(n)</code> and a <code>get</code> of <code>O(1)</code>.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>BST!<ul>
<li>Each node will have either 0, 1, or 2 subtrees.<ul>
<li>Every el in the left subtree will be less than the value of the node.</li>
<li>Every el in the right will be greater.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Just have to change pointers, then, to add.<ul>
<li>Basically just walk down the tree and find the right spot.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Roughly <code>O(log n)</code> on <code>get</code>, <code>add</code>, and <code>delete</code>.<ul>
<li>Can be as bad as <code>O(n)</code> if a sorted list is stuck in there.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Solution to some of the problems of a BST? AVL tree.<ul>
<li>(It&#39;s got some long name, so we&#39;ll stick with the abbreviation.)<ul>
<li>This is a &#39;self-balancing binary search tree.&#39;</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>BSTs can get out of whack.</li>
<li>An AVL tree is always a valid BST (but not always the other way around).</li>
<li>Adding works the same, except that you check to see if the node is balanced after adding.</li>
<li>It&#39;s unbalanced if there&#39;s a height difference greater than one on the subtrees.</li>
<li>Worst case? <code>O(log n)</code>.</li>
<li>You could end up in a situation where you need a double rotation.<ul>
<li>Basically, if the opposite child is heavy during rotation.</li>
<li>So before you do the (probably initially intended) rotation, you do one on the root
node of that rotation, opposite-wise.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Hash tables have constant-time get, delete, and add (if you&#39;re working with a set or a map).<ul>
<li>So, you&#39;ve got a key, and you hash that (MD5 or whatever).<ul>
<li>Now we&#39;ve got a key that points to some addressable space.</li>
<li>This isn&#39;t really a thing in JS.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>This is neat in other languages because you can just work against that space, without
needing to do the (logic) work of hunting things down, kinda, basically.</li>
<li>No concept of order.</li>
<li>Uses a fair bit of memory.</li>
<li>Needs an idempotent hash (that is, a super-pure function -- exact same output, provided the same
input, every single time.).</li>
<li>Hash also has to be very well distributed.</li>
<li>And fast.</li>
<li>Almost probably definitely maybe need to use <code>%</code> to get your hash down to a manageable number you can
actually use (smaller than the largest index of your array).</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="some-fp-basics">Some FP Basics</h2>
<ul>
<li>Purity<ul>
<li>Don&#39;t you dare touch my state!</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>HOF</li>
<li>Vector (or array) programming is especially fp-friendly.<ul>
<li>It makes sense to expect that you can chain functions together.</li>
<li>This ends up being much, <em>much</em> more declarative.</li>
<li>Just think about <code>map</code>, <code>reduce</code>, and <code>filter</code>.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>

      <p><p>A response to <a href="http://www.networkworld.com/article/3050934/macs/on-its-40th-anniversary-40-things-we-love-about-apple.html">this
absurdity</a>.</p>
<p>These are literally just a summary of each of those slides.</p>
<ul>
<li>Apple has a marketing team</li>
<li>their users are obsessed</li>
<li>they make decent clones of other products years after those products are the norm</li>
<li>they don&#39;t know their own target demographic</li>
<li>they make products</li>
<li>they make the same products year after year and announce them as if they&#39;re new</li>
<li>they make inferior products and market them as if they&#39;re worth buying</li>
<li>they still don&#39;t know their own users</li>
<li>their users are still obsessed</li>
<li>they have stores that sell their products</li>
<li>they put their products in boxes</li>
<li>they offer short-term care for their products after you buy them</li>
<li>they have stores that you have to wait to get into</li>
<li>they make products</li>
<li>they made products years ago, too</li>
<li>their products were not the exact same products as other products, years ago</li>
<li>one of the products they used to make was a printer</li>
<li>they also used to make... products</li>
<li>like an idiot, i don&#39;t back up my data. and when a hard drive fails, i prefer to buy a new computer of a different
brand and then blame an entire major segment of consumer electronics for my own stupidity.</li>
<li>i noce bought one of their products</li>
<li>they make overpriced things that don&#39;t offer anything that any other platform doesn&#39;t have, but i by their crap anyway</li>
<li>their smartphones offer all the same functionality that flip phones have</li>
<li>they make apps</li>
<li>at one point the company almost totally failed, but then didn&#39;t</li>
<li>some people who work at Apple aren&#39;t native English speakers</li>
<li>i buy their products both for myself and for my kids sometimes</li>
<li>they made another &#39;new&#39; product that had already been on the market for years</li>
<li>they even had a marketing team back when CDs were still a thing</li>
<li>they made a really shitty mouse that everyone hated, aww, look at them trying, so cute</li>
<li>applescript is such a joke that it wasn&#39;t going to be included in OS X until, whoops, someone put them on the spot
about it</li>
<li>there is a voice assistant</li>
<li>Apple had a version of BASIC which was almost the same but not <em>exactly</em> the same as any of the other BASICs on the
market at the time</li>
<li>they had PR person that nobody liked</li>
<li>their computers can run software, including some games</li>
<li>they have stores not just where you are but in other places also</li>
<li>they have both marketing and PR people</li>
<li>they sometimes sponsor events, in the same way that most large companies sometimes sponsor events</li>
<li>they sometimes have TV commercials</li>
<li>there are people who like their products enough to sometimes write about them</li>
</ul>
<p>... are you fucking kidding me?</p>
<p>Here&#39;s a couple of things to like about Macs/Apple. Keep in mind that I don&#39;t own any Apple products, and haven&#39;t owned
any since before Mac OS X. I have used them regularly over the past several years, though.</p>
<ul>
<li>Their hardware doesn&#39;t suck. It&#39;s not great, performance-wise, for the price, but it&#39;s good hardware.<ul>
<li>Great battery life (due to the fancy it&#39;s-not-in-just-one-place-in-your-laptop battery).</li>
<li>Great displays (if you pay for the great display).</li>
<li>The cases (speaking of their laptops, here) are <em>gorgeous</em>.</li>
<li>They&#39;re super light. Yes, there are Windows laptops that are also super light. Those Windows laptops also probably
cost less and are more powerful, generally. But you can get a powerful Mac that&#39;s also lightweight (for like $3500).</li>
<li>The keyboards, while annoyingly different from literally every other type of computer ever, have a nice feel.
(My current laptop, and the one I used just prior to this one, had equally good keyboards. They&#39;re not only a
Mac thing.)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Under the hood, Mac OS X is a (gimped) BSD. It&#39;s a PITA sometimes to actually get to the good parts, and it&#39;s a lot
easier to just throw Linux on a (much cheaper, probably faster) laptop, but it can be made into a really nice
development environment. It takes some work on any platform (and is virtually impossible on Windows, unless you&#39;re
developing to target Windows), but on Macs it&#39;s a little more difficult to get to the UNIX-y bits than on a Linux or
BSD.</li>
<li>Macs are trendy. People who really believe they &#39;think different&#39; will think you&#39;re cool for having one. Of course,
all that means is that you believe the same marketing as those people, but they&#39;re not a bad bunch to be kinda lumped
together with, usually.</li>
<li>There&#39;s some software (and I&#39;m thinking specifically of design software here) that just isn&#39;t available for other
platforms. I still can&#39;t accept that it&#39;s a good idea to only target Mac, but The Omni Group has been doing it for
like 27 years and they&#39;re still around, so I guess it works. This fits in with the whole &#39;we make products for a
specific type of person and if you are that type of person you NEED to use this product&#39; kind of marketing though.
There are great design tools available on Windows (Adobe products, for example, or Macaw). There are even great tools
for Linux. Go ahead and laugh at GIMP and Inkscape -- they&#39;ve been around forever and are <em>incredibly</em> powerful. And
we (Linux users) also have Scribus, Blender, Lightworks, Krita, Radiance, Darktable (which is hands-down the best RAW
editor I&#39;ve ever seen), and a host of fantastic video tools -- plus, of course, ImageMagick and everything that
allows.</li>
<li>Mac OS X isn&#39;t Windows.<ul>
<li>I should say that Windows <em>is</em> good at some things. I think. Not the OS itself, but having the OS, it&#39;s probably a
good idea if you&#39;re really into games, or developing specifically for Microsoft products (VB, C#, whatever).</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
