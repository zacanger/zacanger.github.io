      <p><p>this was from some reasonably long time ago</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Barbara:</p>
<ul>
<li>Networking events matter.</li>
<li>Barbara from DM2 ended up as the only actual webdev at her company</li>
<li>This kinda means she&#39;s got to be everything from junior dev to PM</li>
<li>Definitely don&#39;t be self-deprecating about stuff.</li>
<li>Express interest outright in companies/their products.</li>
<li>Yeah, sure, don&#39;t talk yourself <em>up</em> too much, but seriously, communicate
well about what you&#39;ve actually managed to do, because they want to know.</li>
<li>Know why it is that a company makes the choices it does. Barbara&#39;s
example: knowing why it was the company she works for uses Angular.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>Mark:</p>
<ul>
<li>Having past projects to talk about <em>really</em> helps. Obviously. Duh.</li>
<li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Situation,_Task,_Action,_Result">STAR</a> is a thing,
and maybe I should actually know what that is, I guess?</li>
<li>This is basically a totally disheartening little talk. What?</li>
<li>They asked him to rewrite his whole project in Scala. I&#39;m confused about what
this guy is actually even talking about. What is this?</li>
<li>His experience is basically one of being put through hell to get in with
some SAAS analytics-analytics company (yes, that&#39;s correct, his company
analyses analytics).</li>
<li>Actual takeaways: go to meetups, network with people, and talk about <em>why</em>
you actually want to be doing this.</li>
<li>Trying out actual interviews (like, with companies where it may or may not
ever happen, but basically you&#39;re not really counting on that working out
anyway) can be a lot more helpful than just going over responses on your own
or in an absolutely-no-pressure kind of situation.</li>
<li>Oh, wait, okay. As depressing as his little bit was, the actual point of it
is this: jump through the hoops, because it&#39;ll probably be worth it. Maybe
the company will pay you for your work on the project (I mean, that&#39;s kinda
becoming normal now, anyway). Maybe they won&#39;t -- and if they don&#39;t, use that
project or whatever on your portfolio.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>Dallin:</p>
<ul>
<li>He likes whatever it is that he does now, I guess.</li>
<li>He has &#39;come to realise more, the many fallacies in his personality.&#39;<ul>
<li>Yay?</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>I don&#39;t know that he has any actual advice. Besides, basically, just kinda
don&#39;t be like him, because he&#39;s more about learning from mistakes than just,
like, maybe, not trying to make as many.</li>
<li>He said a lot of other things but I was too busy being really annoyed with
the damned profiles.devmounta.in project to take any other notes.<ul>
<li>Seriously, it wouldn&#39;t kill people to check pull requests before making
huge commits. I give up.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Dallin learned Ruby in a week between getting hired and actually starting work.
That&#39;s pretty cool. He works mostly in Rails, and I know he does Coffeescript,
so chances are he learned that on the job (knowing Ruby definitely would&#39;ve
helped with that).</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>Jeff:</p>
<ul>
<li>Don&#39;t make portfolio pieces that aren&#39;t accessible.<ul>
<li>Example: his Instagram analytics site.</li>
<li>If this isn&#39;t possible, do a video demo of that project.</li>
</ul>

      <p><p>This should be the very last of my random notes from my time going through
the course at <a href="http://devmounta.in">DevMountain</a>.</p>
<p>Finally.</p>
<p>As always, don&#39;t take this stuff too seriously, there&#39;s a fair chance a lot of
it is not correct, and any opinions have most likely changed maybe probably
sortakinda.</p>
<p>These last bits are in chronological order of file modification date. I believe
this was from during the second week of Angular.</p>

<h2 id="angular">ANGULAR</h2>
<p>so, <code>expressions</code>, basically that&#39;s why we&#39;re gonna be mashing those braces
constantly. it&#39;s kind of like inline scripts, but minus the script tags?</p>
<p><code>directives</code> are the powerful bit. jqueryish dom extension? apparently something
we&#39;ll use a lot is <code>ngRepeat</code>, which, if it means writing less html, is a-ok
with me.</p>
<pre class="hljs"><code><span class="xml"><span class="hljs-tag">&lt;<span class="hljs-title">div</span>&gt;</span>
  <span class="hljs-tag">&lt;<span class="hljs-title">div</span> <span class="hljs-attribute">data-ng-repeat</span>=<span class="hljs-value">&quot;user in users&quot;</span>&gt;</span>
  <span class="hljs-tag">&lt;<span class="hljs-title">h4</span>&gt;</span></span><span class="hljs-expression">{{<span class="hljs-variable">user.name</span>}}</span><span class="xml"><span class="hljs-tag">&lt;/<span class="hljs-title">h4</span>&gt;</span>
  <span class="hljs-tag">&lt;<span class="hljs-title">p</span>&gt;</span></span><span class="hljs-expression">{{<span class="hljs-variable">user.properties</span>}}</span><span class="xml"><span class="hljs-tag">&lt;/<span class="hljs-title">p</span>&gt;</span>
  <span class="hljs-tag">&lt;/<span class="hljs-title">div</span>&gt;</span>
<span class="hljs-tag">&lt;/<span class="hljs-title">div</span>&gt;</span></span></code></pre><p>so it&#39;s like how python folks write python everything, including html; we&#39;re
writing javascriptish markup! it makes sense in those terms. that snippet there
just created that same div for each user in users; say we have several user
objects, it&#39;ll just go right ahead and repeat that markup per user.</p>
<p><code>ngShow</code> determines if an element should be shown or not, based on a boolean.</p>
<pre class="hljs"><code><span class="xml"><span class="hljs-tag">&lt;<span class="hljs-title">div</span> <span class="hljs-attribute">data-ng-repeat</span>=<span class="hljs-value">&quot;pizza in boxes&quot;</span> <span class="hljs-attribute">data-ng-show</span>=<span class="hljs-value">&quot;pizza.topping == &#39;peppers&#39;&quot;</span>&gt;</span>

<span class="hljs-tag">&lt;/<span class="hljs-title">div</span>&gt;</span></span></code></pre><p>guess what. your gross-ass hawaiian pie? not in those divs, no sir.</p>
<p><code>ngSwitch</code> OHH THIS IS USEFUL. we could&#39;ve used this last week.</p>
<pre class="hljs"><code><span class="xml"><span class="hljs-tag">&lt;<span class="hljs-title">div</span> <span class="hljs-attribute">data-ng-switch</span>=<span class="hljs-value">&quot;pizza.photo&quot;</span>&gt;</span>

<span class="hljs-tag">&lt;/<span class="hljs-title">div</span>&gt;</span></span></code></pre><hr>
<p>directives straight up from angular are all named <code>ngSomethingStuff</code>; they&#39;re
used like &quot;ng-something-stuff&quot; (or &quot;data-ng-something-stuff&quot;) in view. they can
also be comments (?), dom elements, or CSS classes (oh hai jquery what up).</p>
<p>one could use &#39;operations&#39; within those little handlebars up there (i believe
we&#39;re calling those <code>expressions</code>, and <code>operations</code> would be our word for
executable snippets, basically?). so <code>{{pizzza.beInMe()}}</code> is totally valid.</p>
<p><code>ngModel</code> to create two-way data-binding.</p>
<p>aaaaand i do believe this example just literally piped a username to uppercase.
OKAY. <code>{{name | uppercase}}</code> that is, apparently, called a <code>filter</code>, though in
the interest of correctness (and also just to irk ryan :P) i&#39;ll keep calling
them pipes, thank you very much.</p>
<p>hmm. it would seem the guy who wrote this intro to angular is either getting
paid by google, or currently sitting on someone&#39;s dick there... some of the
worship is just a wee bit too cloying for real life.</p>
<p><code>ngApp</code> is the directive to include a partial (to bind an application, in the
parlance). <code>ngView</code> to actually use it.</p>
<p><code>.config</code> does (whodathunkit) configuration, basically by d i (?). you <em>could</em>
pass a function with parameters named after what you&#39;re sourcing that way, but
it&#39;s not good practice (actually, i hadn&#39;t thought about that before... what
happens to variables by the time they&#39;ve been through minification, base62, and
gzip? ⊙▃⊙). instead, you should use an array with the names of the elements that
should get all shot up in your page, because, y&#39;know, ain&#39;t no one messing with
your actual data.</p>
<p><code>routes</code> are a big deal, from what i hear. here&#39;s a simple one from this guy&#39;s
blog post:</p>
<pre class="hljs"><code>angularStuff.config([<span class="hljs-string">&#39;$routeProvider&#39;</span>, <span class="hljs-keyword">function</span>(<span class="hljs-variable">$routeProvider</span>) {
  <span class="hljs-variable">$routeProvider</span>.when(<span class="hljs-string">&#39;/objects&#39;</span>, {
        templateURI : <span class="hljs-string">&#39;view/objects.html&#39;</span>
    , controller  : <span class="hljs-string">&#39;ObjCtrl&#39;</span>
    }).otherwise({templateURI : <span class="hljs-string">&#39;view/NOPE.html&#39;</span>})
}])</code></pre><p>please forgive me, but i need to take a minute to say some things that should be
obvious.</p>
<p>yes, this way of working with partials and configs is pretty sweet, but let&#39;s be
honest, here, and very straightforward: partials and templating systems and
whatnot exist solely for the purpose of making things <em>easier</em> on the people
doing the programming. somehow i feel like going with even more nested
punctuation is more of an exercise in concrete poetry than a highly advanced and
developed javascript framework. ugh.</p>
<p><code>.controller</code> is, like, what you use for controllers. <code>$scope</code> links your
controllers and their bound views. (?) (or binded, if you&#39;re this fellow.)</p>
<pre class="hljs"><code>angularThang.controller(<span class="hljs-string">&#39;BTCtrl&#39;</span>, [<span class="hljs-string">&#39;$scope&#39;</span>, <span class="hljs-keyword">function</span> (<span class="hljs-variable">$scope</span>) {
  <span class="hljs-variable">$scope</span>.objects = [{
    key  : <span class="hljs-string">&#39;value&#39;</span>
  , next : <span class="hljs-string">&#39;another&#39;</span>
  },{
    key  : <span class="hljs-string">&#39;let\&#39;</span>s do it again<span class="hljs-string">&#39;
  , next : &#39;</span>okay, now we\<span class="hljs-string">&#39;re done&#39;</span>
  }]
}])</code></pre><p><code>$watch</code> calls a listener for a controller on an attribute of its scope (oh boy,
pronouns, this is fun). <code>$broadcast</code> will trigger an event on a scope, which&#39;ll
be transmitted to that scope, and <em>all</em> of its children. to trigger a global
even, you&#39;d use <code>$rootScope</code>. without copying down every example from this
rather crudely typed out blog post, we&#39;re basically using
<code>$scope.$watch(stuff)</code>, <code>$scope.$broadcast</code>, <code>$scope.$on</code> etc. so, y&#39;know. extra
<code>$$$$$$$$</code> for everyone.</p>
<p>obviously <code>services</code> are gonna be my favourite toy here. there&#39;s an <code>$http</code>
builtin! (i think... as mentioned, this blogger is probably better at writing
code that writing words, so... i don&#39;t really know). so you can inject them (oh
geez, really? we&#39;re going with &#39;inject&#39; here? we couldn&#39;t&#39;ve said &#39;require&#39; or
&#39;load&#39; or some other generic and often used term that could maybe be <em>slightly</em>
less confusing in this context?) into your controllers and whatnots and
fiddlybits, straight up. same goes for custom
services/external/third-party/whatever, i suppose. basically you&#39;ve just got to
have some sort of usable api there for other services &amp; fiddlywhatnots to
access.</p>
<p><code>$http</code> is a thin wrapper on XHR; <code>$resource</code> is higher level (though without
any examples of how, all i have to go on is that you can call POST something
like &#39;save&#39; and get something like &#39;GIMME DAT&#39; or whatever... so... what?). and
i think <code>$resource</code> is <em>not</em> a builtin, because you&#39;d need to have a dependency
on <code>ngResource</code> to use it. and here he says we&#39;ve got <code>$httpBackend</code> built in to
test without a web server, but he doesn&#39;t mention if that&#39;s actually a builtin
or a core module that would need to be required, nor does he mention whether or
not it runs a webserver itself or just sends out a fake packet, internally, or
whatever.</p>
<hr>
<p>so, jeremy&#39;s super-boiled-down 10-second run-through of the MVC pattern
definitely clarified the actual role of the controller. i mean, i kind of
understood that it&#39;s basically binding models and views, but never really
understood it as the actual middleman until just now. that is awfully sensible.</p>
<p>implied, but not stated explicitly: react is less of a bottleneck as a view than
angular is.</p>
<p>something to keep in mind: <code>$scope</code> is straight up two-way binding, not sortof
or sometimes as was implied in the article.</p>
<p>oh, <code>directive</code> is basically just silly slang for attributes.</p>
<p>mismatched bits and bobs? not with angular, it&#39;ll just boink up some fresh new
dom nodes for your loose-ends</p>
<p>$timeout basically same syntax as setTimeout, except</p>
<pre class="hljs"><code><span class="hljs-variable">$timeout</span>(<span class="hljs-keyword">function</span>(){
  <span class="hljs-variable">$scope</span>.thing = <span class="hljs-string">&#39;that&#39;</span>
}, <span class="hljs-number">10000</span>)</code></pre><p>EVEYTHING that goes IN the html that angular will use is INSIDE of
ng-controller, attached to its $scope</p>
<p>so for the  HTML to even give a crap about what&#39;s going on in your javascript,
it&#39;s gotta be in a $scope. everything that you want angular to actually act on
had better be {{}} in the html and $scope in your js</p>
<p>as jeremy explained it, your js as it sits in your files is ALSO basically kind
of a starting point, because (and see 1.md for more notes on triggering events),
what angular does is (he said scan for but i understood it as wait for triggers
from) basically an excuse to go changing things. so your objects, variables,
whatever are OH MY GOD NOW I KNOW WHAT IMMUTABLE JAVASCRIPT IS A BIG DEAL OKAY
(no, not because of angular, but because it just hit me how how loose EVERYTHING
can really be in javascript... wow, no wonder js get so much hate. it probably
deserves it.)</p>
<p>ng-repeat makes a miniature scope for the foo part of <code>ng-repeat=&quot;foo in bar&quot;</code>
-- underneath, i suppose. that&#39;s super slick.</p>
<pre class="hljs"><code>&lt;input ng-model=<span class="hljs-string">&quot;someFilter&quot;</span>&gt; <span class="hljs-comment">// filter is a keyword to angular, it knows to look for a filter as defined by itself</span>
&lt;<span class="hljs-keyword">div</span> ng-repeat=<span class="hljs-string">&quot;some in such | filter: someFilter&quot;</span>&gt;
{{some.stuff}} {{some.things}} <span class="hljs-comment">// okay, and i suppose, it looks like filter is just a builtin that does just that one</span>
{{some.stuff}} {{some.things}} <span class="hljs-comment">// exact thing... it only shows the thing that you&#39;re inputting/providing as a filter</span>
{{some.stuff}} {{some.things}} <span class="hljs-comment">// BUT that does not necessarily have to mean actual filtered string fragments.</span>

<pre class="hljs"><code>var promise = asyncOne().<span class="hljs-keyword">then</span>(asyncTwo)

<span class="hljs-variable">$q</span>.reject(reason) // will <span class="hljs-keyword">return</span> rejected, with provided reason

$.ajax() //jQuery
var jqPromise = $.ajax({
// stuff here })
var angPromise = <span class="hljs-variable">$q</span>.<span class="hljs-keyword">when</span>(jqPromise)

<span class="hljs-variable">$q</span>.all( [] )
// <span class="hljs-keyword">in</span> the above, one passes an <span class="hljs-keyword">array</span> <span class="hljs-keyword">of</span> promises <span class="hljs-keyword">to</span> <span class="hljs-variable">$q</span>.all

//
// angular flow <span class="hljs-keyword">in</span> ten seconds or less:
// this is according <span class="hljs-keyword">to</span> luke, so it<span class="hljs-string">&#39;s probably correct.
// $http.get(url)
// promise.then on that
// to display it, call that function on the service
// return that, $scope.that thing
// {{let&#39;</span>s go ahead and display that.thing however we want that}}

//

// angular hits serious view bottleneck around <span class="hljs-number">1800</span> items.

// node<span class="hljs-string">&#39;s event loop is exactly the same as normal async javascript, just not in a browser

//

$q.defer() // making a promise
$q.resolve() // start resolving that promise, start invoking chain of .then callback functions,
             // aka &#39;</span>i<span class="hljs-string">&#39;m done and it worked!&#39;</span>

doThing(){
  function doThing(){
    var promise = <span class="hljs-variable">$q</span>.defer
    // stuff to do
    // this needs a callback, probably
      function callback(){
        promise.resolve([<span class="hljs-string">&#39;stuff&#39;</span>, <span class="hljs-string">&#39;that you got&#39;</span>, <span class="hljs-string">&#39;because you asked for it&#39;</span>])
      }
    return promise
  }
}

var url = <span class="hljs-string">&#39;http//zacanger.com/blog&quot;
var promise = $q.defer()
$http({
  method: &#39;</span>GET<span class="hljs-string">&#39;
, url: url
}).then(function(response){
  var whatever = response.data
  // do things
})</span></code></pre><p>okay, promises are so much simpler and more straightforward than people are probably thinking.
really, basically, we&#39;re just going over use-cases and examples now. which is totally fine,
of course.</p>
<p>note that when we go ahead and send a buncha chained promises, we&#39;re gonna get stuff back
however it comes back, not in the order we started things. we&#39;d want to sort things after,
if needed, not (obviously) within promises, because that would make all of that redundant;
we&#39;d basically be using promises to run some synchronous javascript, at that point.
dumb.</p>
<p>JSONP: this is how we get around cross-origin problems.</p>

<p>don&#39;t take anything here seriously. i think it&#39;s just interesting to reread

<h2 id="react-meetup-17-nov-2015">React Meetup, 17 Nov, 2015</h2>
<p>React:</p>
<ul>
<li>Good at managing state.</li>

<p>Random-ass notes and stuff.</p>
<p>Erm. Thus far, it&#39;s web architecture 101. Components are a thing. People don&#39;t
like to refresh whole pages. Etc.</p>
<p><code>render() == render: function(){}</code></p>
<p><code>this.setState</code> = important, should always use</p>
<p>React is a view. But, does server-side rendering. Which is much more up my
alley, because it&#39;s not making life miserable for users. We can check that out
when we check out all those other frameworks, for fun.</p>
<p>React is compiled.</p>
<p>Redux is a state container. Which actually makes sense now. Because everything
is state, in React, it seems. So, it abstracts state and manages it
independently from the front-end, which is how React <em>can</em> do it&#39;s thing on the
server.</p>
<p>My god, though, React people are worse than Lisp people. Everything has to be
about how they do things better, even when they very clearly just do things at a
totally okay level.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.quora.com/React-JS-Library/How-was-the-idea-to-develop-React-conceived-and-how-many-people-worked-on-developing-it-and-implementing-it-at-Facebook">OH. It turns out that React looks like PHP to be because it was influenced by XHP</a>.
Which is PHP, influenced by E4X (ECMAScript with random XML all up in it). So
React is Javascript based on PHP based on Javascript based on XML. So it&#39;s
totally okay to think that it&#39;s hideous. That&#39;s good.</p>

<p>i guess probably most of the css things i use are available
as plugins here anyway. (obviously autoprefixer and cssnext,

      <p><p>at work, parallels kept crashing. what led to this:</p>
<ul>
<li>took a system update on the mac from the app store</li>
<li>after rebooting, went over to parallels, which runs windows 10</li>
<li>that needed an update too apparently, so took that</li>
<li>after rebooting the virtual windows, didn&#39;t think about it for a while</li>
<li>went back to it, went to un-suspend or whatever you&#39;d call it, and it crashed</li>
<li>happened several times, tried force quitting, killing all related processes, rebooting the mac, no luck</li>

is gui related, found a lot of other stuff about that that had nothing to do with actually crashing.
anyway, the thing that actually ended up working was:</p>
<p><code>sudo &quot;/Applications/Parallels Desktop.app/Contents/MacOS/inittool&quot; init -b &quot;/Applications/Parallels Desktop.app&quot;</code></p>
<p>note: run that as sudo from your normal user, don&#39;t <code>sudo su</code> and then do it.</p>
<p>after that, i just opened parallels again and it worked. so. idk. no issues since.
if anyone else can&#39;t get anything to work, maybe that&#39;ll help.</p>
