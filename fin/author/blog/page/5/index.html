      <p><p>Because the Redux docs say &quot;Redux is actually really simple!&quot; when sometimes
it&#39;s not, and because those docs themselves are pretty overwhelming when
you&#39;re first trying out Redux, I&#39;m going to attempt to distill the docs and
bits of my own (admittedly limited) personal experience with Redux into a
couple of blog posts.</p>
<hr>
<p>All your data moves in one direction. This is the same as in Flux. You will
always go through the same steps in redux:</p>
<ul>
<li>Action (call <code>store.dispatch()</code> with an object that describes something
happening)</li>
<li>Reducer (pure function called based on the action that was dispatched that
calculates next state)</li>
<li>Your root reducer combines a bunch of reducers&#39; outputs into one state tree
(assuming you have a root reducer, which you probably do)</li>
<li>The store saves the state tree as returned by the above&mdash;now that&#39;s your
state (and at this point anything you subscribed with will be invoked)</li>
</ul>
<p>All your state in redux is just an object&mdash;just one object. It&#39;s probably a
good idea to try to keep that as shallow as possible, and reference things by
keys (IDs), rather than deeply nesting stuff.</p>
<p>Reducers are just functions. They take your existing state (state previous to
acting on it) and an action and output state (new state).</p>
<pre class="hljs"><code>const someReducer = <span class="hljs-function"><span class="hljs-params">(oldState, action)</span> =&gt;</span> newState</code></pre><p>It&#39;s a reducing function just like you&#39;d pass to <code>Array.reduce()</code>, it it should
always be a pure function. Don&#39;t mutate arguments, call non-pure functions, make
API calls, or anything like that in a reducer. If you don&#39;t know what a pure
function is, it&#39;s actually super simple:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Given the same arguments, a pure function will always have the same output.
This means it&#39;s a function who&#39;s result relies solely on its arguments.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>One thing you should get in the habit of doing is using &#39;default arguments.&#39;
This is new in ES2015, and saves you a bit of code. This means you could have
some initial state:</p>
<pre class="hljs"><code>const initState = {
  <span class="hljs-string">something     :</span> <span class="hljs-string">&#39;a&#39;</span>
, <span class="hljs-string">somethingElse :</span> <span class="hljs-string">&#39;b&#39;</span>
}</code></pre><p>And instead of needing to write</p>
<pre class="hljs"><code>const reducer = (<span class="hljs-keyword">state</span>, action) =&gt; {
  if (typeof <span class="hljs-keyword">state</span> === &#39;undefined&#39;) {
    return initState
  }
  // do stuff
}</code></pre><p>You can just do</p>
<pre class="hljs"><code>const reducer = (<span class="hljs-keyword">state</span> = initState, action) =&gt; // do stuff</code></pre><p>Reducers are frequently switch statements. This might seem a little weird at
first, since most JS folks avoid switch statements (I think some linters even
warn about them, saying they&#39;re &#39;confusing&#39;), but it makes sense in reducers
since you can handle various actions in one function. Remember, an action is
just an object: <code>{type: &#39;do_thing&#39;}</code> with possible other fields: <code>{type:
&#39;do_thing&#39;, to: &#39;stuff&#39;}</code>.</p>
<pre class="hljs"><code>const someReducer = (<span class="hljs-keyword">state</span> = initState, action) {
  switch (action.type) {
    case do_stuff:
      return Object.assign({}, <span class="hljs-keyword">state</span>, {something: action.<span class="hljs-keyword">to</span>})
    <span class="hljs-keyword">default</span>:
      return <span class="hljs-keyword">state</span>
  }
}</code></pre><p>Note the <code>Object.assign()</code>&mdash;we don&#39;t mutate state, we return a new state
based on the old state and the action. You&#39;ll probably want to use a polyfill
for <code>.assign()</code>, but chances are you&#39;re already using Babel anyway. You could
also use something from Lodash, Underscore, or some other library.</p>
<p>It&#39;s always a good idea to return <code>state</code> (which is our old state) as a default,
in case we get sent some unexpected action.</p>
<p>It&#39;s also a good idea to split your reducers and compose them:</p>
<pre class="hljs"><code>const firstReducer = (<span class="hljs-keyword">state</span> = {}, action) =&gt; {
  switch (action.type) {
    case something:
      return stuff
    <span class="hljs-keyword">default</span>:
      return <span class="hljs-keyword">state</span>
  }
}

const secondReducer = (<span class="hljs-keyword">state</span> = initState, action) =&gt; {
  switch (action.type) {
    case whatever:
      return firstReducer(<span class="hljs-keyword">state</span>.field, action)
    <span class="hljs-keyword">default</span>
      return <span class="hljs-keyword">state</span>
  }
}</code></pre><p>This means that <code>firstReducer</code> only needs to get the state that it actually
cares about, when it needs to do something. Also note that defaut state is an
empty object there. It could be anything you want it to be, just make sure it&#39;s
the shape your reducer expects to act on.</p>
<p>When you have a lot of reducers, you can use <code>combineReducers</code>:</p>
<pre class="hljs"><code><span class="hljs-literal">import</span> { combineReducers } from <span class="hljs-string">&#39;redux&#39;</span>

<span class="hljs-keyword">const</span> lotsOfReducers = combineReducers({
  firstReducer
, secondReducer
<span class="hljs-comment">// , etc.</span>
})

<span class="hljs-literal">export</span> <span class="hljs-keyword">default</span> lotsOfReducers</code></pre><p>And you can do this as many times as you like, in as many files as you need.</p>
<p>All you&#39;re doing with reducers is taking in the state as it exists, taking in an
action, and outputing the new state. What you&#39;re operating against is the store.</p>
<p>The Store is a really important bit. It holds all the state of your app. This
is different from Flux, where you&#39;d have a lot of little stores. In Redux
there&#39;s only one. It&#39;s accessed similiarly&mdash;you have <code>getState()</code>, you
dispatch actions, and you can have listeners subscribe to changes. To create a
store in Redux, you just use <code>createStore</code>.</p>
<pre class="hljs"><code><span class="hljs-literal">import</span> { createStore } from <span class="hljs-string">&#39;redux&#39;</span>
<span class="hljs-literal">import</span> someReducer from <span class="hljs-string">&#39;./someFile&#39;</span>
<span class="hljs-keyword">const</span> store = createStore(someReducer)
<span class="hljs-comment">// createStore can take your initial state, too</span>
<span class="hljs-keyword">const</span> store = createStore(someReducer, initialState)
<span class="hljs-comment">// and for creating a store as simply as possible (mocking in testing, etc.):</span>
<span class="hljs-keyword">const</span> store = createStore(() =&gt; ({})) <span class="hljs-comment">// your store is just an empty object, now</span></code></pre><p><code>store.subscribe()</code> returns a function for _un_subscribing. So you can do
something like:</p>
<pre class="hljs"><code>const unsubscribe = store.<span class="hljs-function"><span class="hljs-title">subscribe</span><span class="hljs-params">(someListener)</span></span>
<span class="hljs-function"><span class="hljs-title">unsubscribe</span><span class="hljs-params">()</span></span></code></pre></p>

bits of my own (admittedly limited) personal experience with Redux into a
couple of blog posts.</p>
<hr>
<p>The store is an object that holds state. There&#39;s only ever one store in Redux,
with many reducers that act on it.</p>
<p><code>getState()</code> returns the state from the store.</p>
<p><code>subscribe(listener)</code> says &quot;Hey, call <code>listener</code> when the state changes.&quot;</p>
<p>There&#39;s also a <code>replaceReducer</code> but unless you&#39;re writing hot middlware or
something you probably won&#39;t touch this one.</p>
<p>State can by any type, though obviously it&#39;s probably best to just use an
object here.</p>
<p>Actions are always objects, and they always have a <code>type</code>.</p>
<pre class="hljs"><code>store.<span class="hljs-function"><span class="hljs-title">dispatch</span><span class="hljs-params">({type: <span class="hljs-string">&#39;do-stuff&#39;</span>})</span></span>
<span class="hljs-comment">// it&#39;s conventional to use all uppercase, but it&#39;s also hideous. so.</span>
store.<span class="hljs-function"><span class="hljs-title">dispatch</span><span class="hljs-params">({type: <span class="hljs-string">&#39;DO_OTHER_STUFF&#39;</span>, stuff: <span class="hljs-string">&#39;[things to do here, maybe]&#39;</span>})</span></span></code></pre><p>Action creators are functions that create actions based on any sorts of
arguments.</p>
<pre class="hljs"><code><span class="hljs-title">const</span> sendSomeData = &#39;send-some-<span class="hljs-typedef"><span class="hljs-keyword">data</span>&#39;</span>
<span class="hljs-title">const</span> sendSomeDataActionCreator = <span class="hljs-typedef"><span class="hljs-keyword">data</span> =&gt; <span class="hljs-container">({
  <span class="hljs-title">type</span> : <span class="hljs-title">sendSomeData</span>
, <span class="hljs-title">data</span>
})</span></span></code></pre><p>A &#39;bound&#39; action creator would be one that creates the action and immediately
dispatches it. This might be familiar to folks who&#39;ve worked with Flux before.</p>
<p>This is how you might have something like this in Flux:</p>
<pre class="hljs"><code><span class="hljs-keyword">const</span> sendMoreData = data =&gt; {
  <span class="hljs-keyword">const</span> doIt = {
    type : sendMoreData,
    data
  }
  dispatch(doIt)
}</code></pre><p>And this is how it&#39;d work in Redux:</p>
<pre class="hljs"><code><span class="hljs-comment">// assuming you already have the dispatch and action creator, you&#39;d just</span>
const boundSendMoreData = data =&gt;
  <span class="hljs-function"><span class="hljs-title">dispatch</span><span class="hljs-params">(sendMoreData(data)</span></span>)</code></pre><p>There&#39;s also a <code>bindActionCreators()</code> to just do this for you, and React-Redux
has <code>connect()</code>.</p>
<p>Async actions should go through middleware to be turned into regular actions
before being dispatched.</p>
<p>Reducers always take state and an action and return state.
<code>reducer (state, action) =&gt; state</code>
These are what they sound like&mdash;reducing functions.
The state a reducer takes is your existing (or previous, I guess) state.
Reducers are pure functions.</p>
<p>A dispatch is a function that takes an action (or an async action). It may then
dispatch an action (or actions) which will affect the store.
There&#39;s a base <code>dispatch</code> that always sends an action to the reducer.</p>
<p>Middleware are about what you&#39;d expect&mdash;functions (HOF) that take a
dispatch function and return a dispatch function.</p>
<p>There are &#39;store enhancers&#39; that are higher-order functions that take a store
creator and return a different store creator. They&#39;re basically kind of a
middleware for the store creator. You probably won&#39;t directly use one, ever.
Instead you&#39;ll just use the regular store creator (<code>createStore</code>).</p>

      <p><p>I&#39;ve wanted to do something like this for a while (since December-ish), but
haven&#39;t had the time. I have some minor design experience (not a lot), and tend
to read more about interaction design, HCI, and other random
non-programming-but-still-computer-and-person-working-together-related topics
than I do about programming.</p>
<p>Would anyone be interested in seeing something like that? This is a short list
of things I might cover:</p>
<ul>
<li>A11Y</li>
<li>Typography</li>
<li>Colour theory</li>
<li>Whitespace</li>
<li>Scalable design (math; see Basscss)</li>

      <p><p>lol streams are like the weird lovechild of promises and arrays i love that
analogy</p>
<p>here&#39;s a stream-making thingy</p>
<pre class="hljs"><code>const foo = {
  each (cb) {
    setTimeout(<span class="hljs-function"><span class="hljs-params">()</span> =&gt;</span> cb(<span class="hljs-number">1</span>), <span class="hljs-number">100</span>)

  }
}
foo.each(<span class="hljs-built_in">console</span>.log)</code></pre><p>prototypes are faster than factory functions but geez they&#39;re
kinda gross to think about you know so unless we&#39;re doing something
like making ten million objects just use a factory there i guess</p>
<p>streams are functors</p>
<p>functors are just a thing that implements map</p>
<p>monads are functors that also implement <em>flatMap</em></p>
<p>flatMap just flattens, i guess? that&#39;s what it sounds like.</p>
<p>so like with Promises for example, <code>.then</code> is like <code>.flatMap</code>.
same with stuff like bind and chain methods and stuff. it&#39;s basically
flattening into its <em>value</em> rather than having the actual (semi-expected)
value (function/promise/stream/whatever).</p>
<p>so if you have a flatMap that would return another monad, i guess,
it&#39;d actually return its value, not that other monad.</p>
<p>if you are a tooling addict, don&#39;t do tools. (this actually totally applies to
me, because i&#39;ve spent more time on <a href="https://github.com/zacanger/z.git">my dotfiles</a>
than on any other individual project... <em>but</em> i feel like it&#39;s worth it, mostly.
being able to just use vim and not go through the work of setting up any other
editor on any computer, being able to just clone that repo and symlink what i need,
that really does make me more productive. as long as i don&#39;t forget how to use
computers without my dotfiles, i don&#39;t think they&#39;re really a waste of time.)</p>
