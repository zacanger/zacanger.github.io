<p>Dear Zac: Please start writing tests. Thanks! Love, Zac.</p>
<p>&#39;The Overjustification Effect&#39; ... side projects are valuable in multiple ways.
(I think everyone knew this.)</p>
<p>Clojure: in parens, operator and operands. Example: (doThings toThis andThis andThis andThis).</p>
<p>APPARENTLY I know 90% of Clojure, now. Cool. Can someone please explain to me why cljs has
brackets and braces, then? Like... wat?</p>
<ul>
<li>Five steps to understanding a new code base:<ul>
<li>Find a mentor who really understands that code base and is willing and able to take the
time to talk to you about it.</li>
<li>Get an overview of the codebase from said mentor, on style, frameworks, libs, architecture,
etc. for all of it, then go study all those things <em>apart</em> from the current code so you
know how they&#39;re all supposed to work. Also find out the history of the code.</li>
<li>Complete a task. A tiny feature or bugfix or something.</li>
<li>Don&#39;t get stuck. If you&#39;re not getting anything done for more than like a half hour or
whatever and you can&#39;t figure it out, <em>ask that mentor</em>.</li>
<li>Code review, review, review code, code, code review.</li>

<h3 id="functors">FUNCTORS</h3>
<p>I don&#39;t really know what a functor is but apparently map and filter are functors.</p>
<p>Functors are objects that have a map-type method. Not the method itself.</p>
<p>A JS array is a functor. Same with promises (from libraries, not the spec!) and streams.</p>

      <p><h1 id="deploying-docker-images">Deploying Docker Images</h1>
<p>You can use Docker&#39;s repos. That&#39;s the easy way so I won&#39;t talk about it here.
There are loads of good docs out there on that, and anyway, it&#39;s built into the
tools. Instead this post deals with deployment of images that you can&#39;t publish
(like your company&#39;s code).</p>
<h2 id="the-non-repo-way">The non-repo way</h2>
<p>This way doesn&#39;t give you any of the nice features of having a repo, but it&#39;s
also much easier to deal with.</p>
<p>First export your (running) container. Do a <code>docker ps</code> to get its name or ID,
then <code>docker export &lt;that-name&gt; &gt; foo.tar</code>.</p>
<p>Then you&#39;ll want to get it to your server (using <code>sftp</code> or whatever else works
for you). On the server, do a <code>cat foo.tar | docker import -</code></p>
<p>Boom, it&#39;s there. You can run it the same way you would normally (like <code>docker
run -p 80:80 -d foo</code> or whatever).</p>
<h2 id="the-your-own-repo-way">The your-own-repo way</h2>
<p>This is a little more difficult, but you get to keep all the benefits of a
Docker repo without making stuff public.</p>
<p>Get your own repo with <code>docker run -p 5000:5000 samalba/docker-registry</code>.</p>
<p>Hurray, once that&#39;s done you&#39;ll have your own Docker registry running!</p>
<p>Do something like <code>docker login localhost:5000</code> and set up some login
credentials.</p>
<p>To push your stuff to it, first tag it with info, like <code>docker tag
mycompany/theirprivatecode localhost:5000/mycompany/theirprivatecode</code>.</p>
<p>Do use this repo, just use <code>docker push
localhost:5000/mycompany/theirprivatecode</code> instead of pushing to a public repo.</p>
<p>You&#39;ll want to do a <code>docker ps</code> and get the container ID for your local
registry, and commit that so you don&#39;t lose your stuff. Or you can use <code>-v</code> or
set up volumes.</p>
<p>You&#39;ll want to do a <code>docker ps</code> and get the container ID for your local
registry, and commit that so you don&#39;t lose your stuff. Or you can use <code>-v</code> or
set up volumes.</p>
<p>Okay, so probably you&#39;ll want to put that somewhere not-on-your-local-machine.
<code>ssh</code> into your server and do an <code>ssh -R 5000:localhost:5000 -l</code> to forwared
that port. Then to deploy forreal, just <code>docker pull
localhost:5000/mycompany/theirprivatecode</code>.</p>
<p>Then to run it you should be able to just <code>docker run
mycompany/theirprivatecode</code>.</p>

<p>methods: possible to define custom</p>
<p>get, put, and delete are really obvious</p>
<p>patch: like put, but for small changes</p>
<p>head: get, but for just meta about the resource</p>

(useful for... cors, i guess)</p>
<p>post: kind of a catch-all for whatever else you want to do rly
it&#39;s not actually intended to be used as the C in CRUD</p>
<p>i may be rethinking my position on url parameters vs queries</p>
<p>remembering, from <a href="http://mdkb.zacanger.com/urls">my docs</a>:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2396.txt">URLs</a> are made up of (usually just some) of these parts:
<code>&lt;scheme&gt;://&lt;username&gt;:&lt;password&gt;@&lt;host&gt;:&lt;port&gt;/&lt;path&gt;;&lt;parameters&gt;?&lt;query&gt;#&lt;fragment&gt;</code>.</p>
<ul>
<li>The scheme is the <em>protocol</em> (http, https, ftp, git, etc.). It ends with <code>:</code> (not <code>//</code>).</li>
<li>The username and password are fairly self-explanitory, and we don&#39;t see that a whole whole lot these days, except
maybe in FTP.</li>
<li>The host is the part we all know well, like &#39;github&#39; or &#39;google.&#39; It can be a domain name or an IP address.</li>
<li>The port (80 for HTTP, 443 for HTTPS, etc.) is self-explanitory; defaults to 80.</li>
<li>The path would be segments (like <code>/doc/search</code> or whatever), and can contain semicolons to separate parameters (like <code>thing=foo;stuff=bar</code>).</li>
<li>Queries can be before or after parameters, and that&#39;d be something like <code>/?q=foo+bar</code>.</li>
<li>Fragments are for specific parts of a resource, like <code>somepage.html#somesection</code>.</li>
<li><code>; / ? : @ &amp; = + $ ,</code> are reserved characters (meaning they have special uses in URLs).</li>
<li><code>- _ . ! ~ * &#39; ( )</code> are unreserved (you can use them almost wherever you&#39;d like).</li>
<li><code>{ } | \\ ^ [ ] \</code> ` are unwise to use in URLs (note that this includes the backslash and backtick/grave, which may not render in Markdown code blocks, depending on parser).</li>
<li><code>&lt; &gt; # % &quot;</code> don&#39;t use these, at all (except the <code>%</code> and <code>#</code> <em>if</em> you have a valid reason for it, because they do special things in URLs).</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<ul>
<li>content headers from client to specify what it can be (accept)</li>
<li>content headers from server to specify what it is (content-type)</li>
</ul>

      <p><p>just a few clojure notes</p>
<p>i don&#39;t know if any of this is vastly different from cljs? i&#39;d think not,
because really you&#39;re just talking about a different target (jvm vs js vm), rite?
but who knows. i mean, normally you wouldn&#39;t talk about clojure and clojurescript
with two different names if they were the exact same language and the only actual
difference was the target vm.</p>
<p>i&#39;d look this up but i&#39;m on a plane. so.</p>

<p>there are transducers, which are <em>not</em> like a <code>map</code> or <code>functor</code> or whatever.</p>
<p>these are composable transforms</p>
<p>did i mention that i&#39;m in an airport? all night, i&#39;ll be here.
meant to be home by now. in bed. sleeping. having seen the people i really miss,
hugs all around, had a beer, unpacked, showered maybe, gone to bed.
i&#39;ll be home, instead, by maybe noon-ish tomorrow possibly, having missed
another day of work, sweaty and gross, eurgh.</p>

    </header>
    <section class="post-content">
      <p><p>one of my pet peeves is seeing people who make software for a living doing
things in incredibly slow/unproductive ways. i know everyone has their own
ways of being awesome, and most of those ways are much more awesome ways than
the ways in which i am okay at things, but still, there are better ways, and
most developers i&#39;ve seen just have <em>no</em> idea how much time they waste.</p>
<p>so here are just some tiny little tips. none of these are big news, none
are esoteric, none are risky, all require a little bit of work but make things
a lot faster in a very short period of time.</p>
<h2 id="bash-things">bash things</h2>
<p>you can use zsh, and that&#39;s a thing, and it doesn&#39;t suck, okay, but it pays
to be good at bash. bash is everywhere. it&#39;s the default shell on just about
every system. zsh gives you nice things, but you can get all the same nice
things in bash with just a tiny bit of work.</p>
<p>the number one most useful thing to do with bash is aliases, i think.
it&#39;s generally recommended that you use functions if you can, but there&#39;s
really no harm in using aliases. try these out, for example:</p>
<pre class="hljs"><code><span class="hljs-keyword">alias</span> <span class="hljs-title">ns</span>=<span class="hljs-comment">&#39;npm start&#39;</span>
<span class="hljs-keyword">alias</span> <span class="hljs-title">nt</span>=<span class="hljs-comment">&#39;npm test&#39;</span>
<span class="hljs-keyword">alias</span> <span class="hljs-title">nis</span>=<span class="hljs-comment">&#39;npm i -S&#39;</span>
<span class="hljs-keyword">alias</span> <span class="hljs-title">nid</span>=<span class="hljs-comment">&#39;npm i -D&#39;</span>
<span class="hljs-keyword">alias</span> <span class="hljs-title">bn</span>=<span class="hljs-comment">&#39;babel-node&#39;</span></code></pre><p>throw these at the bottom of your <code>~/.bashrc</code> (or <code>~/.bash_profile</code> on a mac).</p>
<h2 id="npm">npm</h2>
<p>for that matter, there&#39;s the aliases up there... npm has a bunch built-in.
for example, you never need to type out <code>npm install --save-dev</code>
-- just do <code>npm i -S</code>.</p>
<p>npm gives you a million things. just read the docs sometime. or the help screens.</p>
<h2 id="the-terminal">the terminal</h2>
<p>use readline stuff. ctrl-w, ctrl-a, ctrl-e, even just those, just use them. ctrl-arrow
(or option-arrow on mac) to get around between words. use these things.</p>
<p>set your prompt up to tell you nice stuff. i <em>highly</em> recommend using liquidprompt
(<code>apt-get install -y liquidprompt</code> or <code>brew install liquidprompt</code>), but you can
also do all these things manually (check
<a href="https://github.com/zacanger/z/blob/master/.bashrc#L127">my dotfiles</a> for examples).</p>
<p>pick a bookmarking system and stick with it. <a href="https://github.com/wting/autojump">there</a>
<a href="https://github.com/rupa/z">are</a> a <a href="https://github.com/shyiko/commacd">bunch</a> of them
out there (many many more, just search). or export aliases to move to places. or you
<a href="https://github.com/zacanger/z/blob/master/.bash_functions/g.sh">can</a>
<a href="https://github.com/zacanger/z/blob/master/.bash_functions/ga.sh">use</a>
<a href="https://github.com/zacanger/z/blob/master/.bash_functions/gt.sh">mine</a> if you&#39;d like.</p>
<h2 id="markdown">markdown</h2>
<p>if you don&#39;t use it, use it. if you still click around in microsoft word or google docs,
goddamn, take two minutes to learn the easiest and most popular plain-to-rich-text
lightweight-markup authoring format out there. it&#39;s the only way to write, really.</p>
<h2 id="your-editor">your editor</h2>
<p>i don&#39;t care what your editor is. i really don&#39;t. i know just enough about lisp
to not even hate emacs users. i do dislike VS Code, but mostly because of the
idiotic and transparent licensing scheme. and also because it&#39;s not a very
good editor. but the built-in debugger isn&#39;t bad (you can get all the same things
from other tools, but it is better than the ones that you can get for most other
editors for node).</p>
<p>whatever your editor is, take a week to learn it really well. in my case, finally
just spending some time getting <em>fluid</em> with vim has made a huge difference.
i no longer have any other editors installed (and i tried a lot of them! i loved
<a href="http://lighttable.com/">LightTable</a> and <a href="http://foicica.com/textadept/">Textadept</a>
especially, and also really liked atom (but it&#39;s <em>slow</em>); brackets was a waste of
my time, sublime was okay but nonfree and there&#39;s textadept so whatever, see above
for notes on VS code; actual IDEs i tent to avoid because they&#39;re just overwhelmingly
large and in the way all the time, to me). that doesn&#39;t mean vim&#39;s the <em>best</em> editor
(though it totally is), it just means it&#39;s the one i decided i wanted use, and it&#39;s
the absolute best tool that i have now because i&#39;m pretty quick with it.</p>
<p>even if you use vs code or brackets (i&#39;d advise you not to do so, but it&#39;s up to
you...), just take the time to learn your editor well. learn its plugin/extension/
whatever system, find or write a theme that makes things really easy on you, check
out <a href="https://medium.com/@evnbr/coding-in-color-3a6db2743a1e#.5rffb0gto">semantic highlighting</a>
and give that a shot for a week, find a way to open a terminal in your editor
(because you DO need that) if it&#39;s a graphical editor, learn keybinds, learn
configs, and make it work for you. that sounds like a lot of work put into something
that&#39;s not directly <strong>work</strong>, but it&#39;s work invested in yourself being better
at using your tools.</p>
<p>laurie voss, the cto of npm, said in a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NWo-RIHiEJ4">talk</a>
that one of the most important things you can do is be good at your editor.
he&#39;s obviously right. he&#39;s laurie voss.</p>
<h2 id="use-git">use git</h2>
<p>this should be obvious. but, i mean, really use it. use it enough that you
learn how to use a gitconfig, templates, etc., and try out lots of different
extensions and wrappers for git (like hub, legit, ghcli, etc.). do stuff with
git. get really comfortable with git. it&#39;s important. other version control also
matters sometimes in some businesses but really really really spend some time
learning git.</p>
<h2 id="configs">configs</h2>
<p>(<a href="https://github.com/zacanger/z">like these</a>)</p>
<p>organize yours. store them somewhere, like in a repo. because when your current
computer dies (and it will), it&#39;ll take you weeks to get things feeling decent
if you have to recreate everything manually. granted, most people don&#39;t have
dotfiles nearly as extensive as those, but you don&#39;t need to -- i&#39;m a little bit
of a hoarder. disk space is cheap. whatever.</p>
