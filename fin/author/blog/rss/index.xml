<p>It&#39;s pretty simple. Shouldn&#39;t be too hard to grasp, maybe a little harder to
implement.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Have confidence in your code.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>If you don&#39;t have confidence in your code, then try this:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Write code in which you have confience.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It really sucks to have to walk someone through your  code when you&#39;re not
sure it&#39;s even doing the things it&#39;s supposed to do, or when you <em>are</em> sure
it&#39;s doing the right things but doing them in a really gross kind of way.</p>
<p>I think this is something everyone struggles with. It&#39;s really easy to copy
and paste stuff from StackOverflow, and everyone does it for a while. I still
do it sometimes, though usually with a lot of testing and reading before
actually running that code.</p>
<p>It&#39;s really easy, as a new dev, to say &quot;Well, I don&#39;t know how to do that thing,
can you just show me?&quot; And that&#39;s okay, but it&#39;s a lot more okay to say &quot;Hey,
I spent an hour with the docs, here&#39;s my implementation, here&#39;s the stack trace
and I couldn&#39;t find anything helpful on the source&#39;s issues or SO, do you have
any ideas?&quot;</p>
<p>It takes a while to write code that you don&#39;t hate, but usually even someone
who&#39;s been programming for a few months knows what good code looks like. It&#39;s
concise, readable, logical, and consistent. It doesn&#39;t make you cringe.</p>
<p>I&#39;m not really very good at writing code and feeling great about it. When it
comes to, say, raw Node or a Bash script, I&#39;m usually better with these things
than anyone I know on a personal level, and have no problem taking charge and
just doing things. But when it comes to the things I actually do every day
(which right now means React, Koa, AWS stuff, Docker, trying to read C#, and
Sass, mostly) I know I&#39;m not that great. Knowing that I&#39;m not that great means
I take probably twice as long as I would to get anything done as I would if I
was the best at that thing in the room, because I know people who know more
than I do will be looking at my code and will need to fix it.</p>
<p>That&#39;s not a <strong>bad</strong> thing, but it&#39;s not a good thing either. It means I&#39;m
programming without confidence, when I&#39;m writing React or Sass. And I&#39;m not
even <em>bad</em> at either, I just have no confidence when writing these things
on a project with people who are better at them than I am. That&#39;s something
that I should get over.</p>
<p>Anyway, I meant to write this post on the train and post it when I got home,
but I ended up standing on the train so it&#39;s split, from while waiting for the
train &#39;til 10:30 PM while sitting at DevMountain, so it&#39;s probably a little
disjointed.</p>
<p>The point here is, if you have confidence in what you&#39;re doing, you&#39;ll get
stuff done quicker and better, and if you don&#39;t have confidence in what you&#39;re
doing, make it so that you can.</p>

<p>&#39;The Overjustification Effect&#39; ... side projects are valuable in multiple ways.
(I think everyone knew this.)</p>
<p>Clojure: in parens, operator and operands. Example: (doThings toThis andThis andThis andThis).</p>
<p>APPARENTLY I know 90% of Clojure, now. Cool. Can someone please explain to me why cljs has
brackets and braces, then? Like... wat?</p>
<ul>
<li>Five steps to understanding a new code base:<ul>
<li>Find a mentor who really understands that code base and is willing and able to take the
time to talk to you about it.</li>
<li>Get an overview of the codebase from said mentor, on style, frameworks, libs, architecture,
etc. for all of it, then go study all those things <em>apart</em> from the current code so you
know how they&#39;re all supposed to work. Also find out the history of the code.</li>
<li>Complete a task. A tiny feature or bugfix or something.</li>
<li>Don&#39;t get stuck. If you&#39;re not getting anything done for more than like a half hour or
whatever and you can&#39;t figure it out, <em>ask that mentor</em>.</li>
<li>Code review, review, review code, code, code review.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="functors">FUNCTORS</h3>
<p>I don&#39;t really know what a functor is but apparently map and filter are functors.</p>
<p>Functors are objects that have a map-type method. Not the method itself.</p>
<p>A JS array is a functor. Same with promises (from libraries, not the spec!) and streams.</p>

<p>You can use Docker&#39;s repos. That&#39;s the easy way so I won&#39;t talk about it here.
There are loads of good docs out there on that, and anyway, it&#39;s built into the
tools. Instead this post deals with deployment of images that you can&#39;t publish
(like your company&#39;s code).</p>
<h2 id="the-non-repo-way">The non-repo way</h2>
<p>This way doesn&#39;t give you any of the nice features of having a repo, but it&#39;s
also much easier to deal with.</p>
<p>First export your (running) container. Do a <code>docker ps</code> to get its name or ID,
then <code>docker export &lt;that-name&gt; &gt; foo.tar</code>.</p>
<p>Then you&#39;ll want to get it to your server (using <code>sftp</code> or whatever else works
for you). On the server, do a <code>cat foo.tar | docker import -</code></p>
<p>Boom, it&#39;s there. You can run it the same way you would normally (like <code>docker
run -p 80:80 -d foo</code> or whatever).</p>
<h2 id="the-your-own-repo-way">The your-own-repo way</h2>
<p>This is a little more difficult, but you get to keep all the benefits of a
Docker repo without making stuff public.</p>
<p>Get your own repo with <code>docker run -p 5000:5000 samalba/docker-registry</code>.</p>
<p>Hurray, once that&#39;s done you&#39;ll have your own Docker registry running!</p>
<p>Do something like <code>docker login localhost:5000</code> and set up some login
credentials.</p>
<p>To push your stuff to it, first tag it with info, like <code>docker tag
mycompany/theirprivatecode localhost:5000/mycompany/theirprivatecode</code>.</p>
<p>Do use this repo, just use <code>docker push
localhost:5000/mycompany/theirprivatecode</code> instead of pushing to a public repo.</p>
<p>You&#39;ll want to do a <code>docker ps</code> and get the container ID for your local
registry, and commit that so you don&#39;t lose your stuff. Or you can use <code>-v</code> or
set up volumes.</p>
<p>You&#39;ll want to do a <code>docker ps</code> and get the container ID for your local
registry, and commit that so you don&#39;t lose your stuff. Or you can use <code>-v</code> or
set up volumes.</p>
<p>Okay, so probably you&#39;ll want to put that somewhere not-on-your-local-machine.
<code>ssh</code> into your server and do an <code>ssh -R 5000:localhost:5000 -l</code> to forwared
that port. Then to deploy forreal, just <code>docker pull
localhost:5000/mycompany/theirprivatecode</code>.</p>
<p>Then to run it you should be able to just <code>docker run
mycompany/theirprivatecode</code>.</p>

<p>representations: dictionaries of actual resources</p>
<p>eh?</p>
<p>example: url: foo.bar/video with:
representations: various formats and sizes of said video</p>
<p>methods: possible to define custom</p>
<p>get, put, and delete are really obvious</p>
<p>patch: like put, but for small changes</p>
<p>head: get, but for just meta about the resource</p>
<p>options: what all can i even do with this thing?
(useful for... cors, i guess)</p>
<p>post: kind of a catch-all for whatever else you want to do rly
it&#39;s not actually intended to be used as the C in CRUD</p>
<p>i may be rethinking my position on url parameters vs queries</p>
<p>remembering, from <a href="http://mdkb.zacanger.com/urls">my docs</a>:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2396.txt">URLs</a> are made up of (usually just some) of these parts:
<code>&lt;scheme&gt;://&lt;username&gt;:&lt;password&gt;@&lt;host&gt;:&lt;port&gt;/&lt;path&gt;;&lt;parameters&gt;?&lt;query&gt;#&lt;fragment&gt;</code>.</p>
<ul>
<li>The scheme is the <em>protocol</em> (http, https, ftp, git, etc.). It ends with <code>:</code> (not <code>//</code>).</li>
<li>The username and password are fairly self-explanitory, and we don&#39;t see that a whole whole lot these days, except
maybe in FTP.</li>
<li>The host is the part we all know well, like &#39;github&#39; or &#39;google.&#39; It can be a domain name or an IP address.</li>
<li>The port (80 for HTTP, 443 for HTTPS, etc.) is self-explanitory; defaults to 80.</li>
<li>The path would be segments (like <code>/doc/search</code> or whatever), and can contain semicolons to separate parameters (like <code>thing=foo;stuff=bar</code>).</li>
<li>Queries can be before or after parameters, and that&#39;d be something like <code>/?q=foo+bar</code>.</li>
<li>Fragments are for specific parts of a resource, like <code>somepage.html#somesection</code>.</li>
<li><code>; / ? : @ &amp; = + $ ,</code> are reserved characters (meaning they have special uses in URLs).</li>
<li><code>- _ . ! ~ * &#39; ( )</code> are unreserved (you can use them almost wherever you&#39;d like).</li>
<li><code>{ } | \\ ^ [ ] \</code> ` are unwise to use in URLs (note that this includes the backslash and backtick/grave, which may not render in Markdown code blocks, depending on parser).</li>
<li><code>&lt; &gt; # % &quot;</code> don&#39;t use these, at all (except the <code>%</code> and <code>#</code> <em>if</em> you have a valid reason for it, because they do special things in URLs).</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<ul>
<li>content headers from client to specify what it can be (accept)</li>
<li>content headers from server to specify what it is (content-type)</li>
</ul>
<p>cache-control, last-modified, and etag to control caching</p>
<p>client will check if-modified-since and if-none-match</p>
<p>accept-encoding (with gzip or compress) yay</p>
<p>on server, max-age and etag ; send 304 if if-no-match matches etag</p>

<p>i don&#39;t know if any of this is vastly different from cljs? i&#39;d think not,
because really you&#39;re just talking about a different target (jvm vs js vm), rite?
but who knows. i mean, normally you wouldn&#39;t talk about clojure and clojurescript
with two different names if they were the exact same language and the only actual
difference was the target vm.</p>
<p>i&#39;d look this up but i&#39;m on a plane. so.</p>

<p>did i mention i was on a plane? i wasn&#39;t <em>really</em> on a plane. i&#39;m in an airport.
for a lot of hours. it&#39;s a long story. sort of. it&#39;s actually a relatively short
story, but it&#39;s kind of boring. so whatever.</p>
<p>there are transducers, which are <em>not</em> like a <code>map</code> or <code>functor</code> or whatever.</p>
<p>these are composable transforms</p>
<p>did i mention that i&#39;m in an airport? all night, i&#39;ll be here.
meant to be home by now. in bed. sleeping. having seen the people i really miss,
hugs all around, had a beer, unpacked, showered maybe, gone to bed.
i&#39;ll be home, instead, by maybe noon-ish tomorrow possibly, having missed
another day of work, sweaty and gross, eurgh.</p>
<p>on the other hand i met some nice people suck in this zombie airport, so.</p>

things in incredibly slow/unproductive ways. i know everyone has their own
ways of being awesome, and most of those ways are much more awesome ways than
the ways in which i am okay at things, but still, there are better ways, and
most developers i&#39;ve seen just have <em>no</em> idea how much time they waste.</p>
<p>so here are just some tiny little tips. none of these are big news, none
are esoteric, none are risky, all require a little bit of work but make things
a lot faster in a very short period of time.</p>
<h2 id="bash-things">bash things</h2>
<p>you can use zsh, and that&#39;s a thing, and it doesn&#39;t suck, okay, but it pays
to be good at bash. bash is everywhere. it&#39;s the default shell on just about
every system. zsh gives you nice things, but you can get all the same nice
things in bash with just a tiny bit of work.</p>
<p>the number one most useful thing to do with bash is aliases, i think.
it&#39;s generally recommended that you use functions if you can, but there&#39;s
really no harm in using aliases. try these out, for example:</p>
<pre class="hljs"><code><span class="hljs-keyword">alias</span> <span class="hljs-title">ns</span>=<span class="hljs-comment">&#39;npm start&#39;</span>
<span class="hljs-keyword">alias</span> <span class="hljs-title">nt</span>=<span class="hljs-comment">&#39;npm test&#39;</span>
<span class="hljs-keyword">alias</span> <span class="hljs-title">nis</span>=<span class="hljs-comment">&#39;npm i -S&#39;</span>
<span class="hljs-keyword">alias</span> <span class="hljs-title">nid</span>=<span class="hljs-comment">&#39;npm i -D&#39;</span>
<span class="hljs-keyword">alias</span> <span class="hljs-title">bn</span>=<span class="hljs-comment">&#39;babel-node&#39;</span></code></pre><p>throw these at the bottom of your <code>~/.bashrc</code> (or <code>~/.bash_profile</code> on a mac).</p>
<h2 id="npm">npm</h2>
<p>for that matter, there&#39;s the aliases up there... npm has a bunch built-in.
for example, you never need to type out <code>npm install --save-dev</code>
-- just do <code>npm i -S</code>.</p>
<p>npm gives you a million things. just read the docs sometime. or the help screens.</p>
<h2 id="the-terminal">the terminal</h2>
<p>use readline stuff. ctrl-w, ctrl-a, ctrl-e, even just those, just use them. ctrl-arrow
(or option-arrow on mac) to get around between words. use these things.</p>
<p>set your prompt up to tell you nice stuff. i <em>highly</em> recommend using liquidprompt
(<code>apt-get install -y liquidprompt</code> or <code>brew install liquidprompt</code>), but you can
also do all these things manually (check
<a href="https://github.com/zacanger/z/blob/master/.bashrc#L127">my dotfiles</a> for examples).</p>
<p>pick a bookmarking system and stick with it. <a href="https://github.com/wting/autojump">there</a>
<a href="https://github.com/rupa/z">are</a> a <a href="https://github.com/shyiko/commacd">bunch</a> of them
out there (many many more, just search). or export aliases to move to places. or you
<a href="https://github.com/zacanger/z/blob/master/.bash_functions/g.sh">can</a>
<a href="https://github.com/zacanger/z/blob/master/.bash_functions/ga.sh">use</a>
<a href="https://github.com/zacanger/z/blob/master/.bash_functions/gt.sh">mine</a> if you&#39;d like.</p>
<h2 id="markdown">markdown</h2>
<p>if you don&#39;t use it, use it. if you still click around in microsoft word or google docs,
goddamn, take two minutes to learn the easiest and most popular plain-to-rich-text
lightweight-markup authoring format out there. it&#39;s the only way to write, really.</p>
<h2 id="your-editor">your editor</h2>
<p>i don&#39;t care what your editor is. i really don&#39;t. i know just enough about lisp
to not even hate emacs users. i do dislike VS Code, but mostly because of the
idiotic and transparent licensing scheme. and also because it&#39;s not a very
good editor. but the built-in debugger isn&#39;t bad (you can get all the same things
from other tools, but it is better than the ones that you can get for most other
editors for node).</p>
<p>whatever your editor is, take a week to learn it really well. in my case, finally
just spending some time getting <em>fluid</em> with vim has made a huge difference.
i no longer have any other editors installed (and i tried a lot of them! i loved
<a href="http://lighttable.com/">LightTable</a> and <a href="http://foicica.com/textadept/">Textadept</a>
especially, and also really liked atom (but it&#39;s <em>slow</em>); brackets was a waste of
my time, sublime was okay but nonfree and there&#39;s textadept so whatever, see above
for notes on VS code; actual IDEs i tent to avoid because they&#39;re just overwhelmingly
large and in the way all the time, to me). that doesn&#39;t mean vim&#39;s the <em>best</em> editor
(though it totally is), it just means it&#39;s the one i decided i wanted use, and it&#39;s
the absolute best tool that i have now because i&#39;m pretty quick with it.</p>
<p>even if you use vs code or brackets (i&#39;d advise you not to do so, but it&#39;s up to
you...), just take the time to learn your editor well. learn its plugin/extension/
whatever system, find or write a theme that makes things really easy on you, check
out <a href="https://medium.com/@evnbr/coding-in-color-3a6db2743a1e#.5rffb0gto">semantic highlighting</a>
and give that a shot for a week, find a way to open a terminal in your editor
(because you DO need that) if it&#39;s a graphical editor, learn keybinds, learn
configs, and make it work for you. that sounds like a lot of work put into something
that&#39;s not directly <strong>work</strong>, but it&#39;s work invested in yourself being better
at using your tools.</p>
<p>laurie voss, the cto of npm, said in a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NWo-RIHiEJ4">talk</a>
that one of the most important things you can do is be good at your editor.
he&#39;s obviously right. he&#39;s laurie voss.</p>
<h2 id="use-git">use git</h2>
<p>this should be obvious. but, i mean, really use it. use it enough that you
learn how to use a gitconfig, templates, etc., and try out lots of different
extensions and wrappers for git (like hub, legit, ghcli, etc.). do stuff with
git. get really comfortable with git. it&#39;s important. other version control also
matters sometimes in some businesses but really really really spend some time
learning git.</p>
<h2 id="configs">configs</h2>
<p>(<a href="https://github.com/zacanger/z">like these</a>)</p>
<p>organize yours. store them somewhere, like in a repo. because when your current
computer dies (and it will), it&#39;ll take you weeks to get things feeling decent
if you have to recreate everything manually. granted, most people don&#39;t have
dotfiles nearly as extensive as those, but you don&#39;t need to -- i&#39;m a little bit
of a hoarder. disk space is cheap. whatever.</p>

<p>If you don&#39;t know what that means, don&#39;t worry.</p>
<p>There once was a time when browser extensions/add-ons didn&#39;t exist, and a
slightly later time when they did exist but still really sucked. And, I mean,
you can still get a lot more out of arbitrary JS than you can out of an
extension, usually.</p>
<p>Bookmarklets are little bits of JS saved as a bookmark. When you click or
navigate to that bookmark, the browser just executes it. You can do some pretty
nifty things with them. I have <a href="https://pinboard.in/u:zacanger">45748 bookmarks saved on Pinboard</a>,
and the only bookmarks I have in my browsers are little snippets of JavaScript.</p>
<p>I&#39;m not going to post all of them here (I have about 150), just some of the most
useful ones.</p>
<p>You can save any bit of JS you&#39;d like as a bookmark. Just prepend <code>javascript:</code>
to some code, as in <code>javascript:console.log(&#39;foo&#39;);alert(&#39;bar&#39;);</code>.</p>

in like two comments somewhere just because there was something actually

<p>Don&#39;t use Mongoose. Mongoose actually does have all the problems I thought it
had. Try Mongolayer at least once. <a href="https://github.com/simpleviewinc/mongolayer">https://github.com/simpleviewinc/mongolayer</a>
<code>npm i --save mongolayer</code></p>
<p>Recursive populates, create vs insert fixed, find/create and save using
different syntax fixed, and each document only having the fields added to it,
rather than being a whole new instance of the schema fixed. Records getting
default values instead of not filling that field fixed. Plus other things.</p>
<hr>
<p>Generators DO look just like infinite loops. I&#39;m not wrong. Turns out that&#39;s
because they are infinite loops, but that&#39;s okay, because they&#39;re basically kind
of backgrounded until called. You hit it up with an iterator, get what you need,
and then it goes back to sleep. So, in a way, maybe that&#39;s kind of like a
builtin thing that you&#39;d imagine needs to be an infinite loop, but isn&#39;t in the
way because you only poke it when you need it. (Like Math.random(), kinda?)
That&#39;s my interpretation, anyway.</p>

<p>Type <em>introspection</em> is a feature of languages where, at runtime (which, for the
sake of keeping it in my head, we&#39;ll say is when said language goes from source
to not-source, whether that&#39;s a binary or a browser window, or whatever... (Java
bytecode doesn&#39;t count, I&#39;m not even sure where it falls on the range of
&#39;scripting&#39; to &#39;compiled&#39;)  a program can take a peek inside and see what the
<em>type</em> of an <em>object</em> is.</p>

<p><code>node-schedule</code> seems quite popular. It&#39;s a &#39;cron-like&#39; and &#39;not-cron-like&#39;
scheduler. I believe that means it&#39;s a scheduler, but it&#39;s time based instead of
interval based (because <code>setInterval</code> exists). Node-schedule is for in-process
scheduling, so once your script has executed, it&#39;s gone (and then cron makes a
lot more sense, because otherwise you&#39;d have to write a script just to start
node-schedule to do whatever it is that you need done at whatever time and/or

<p>A package for nw.js is a zip archive wit hthe extension &#39;nw.&#39; There must be a

<p>&#39;nodejs&#39; field on package.json is boolean; set false to disable node running

<p>More on nw stuff:</p>
<p>whether a .nw file (renamed zip) or project directory, the package.json needs to
be in the root, and if it&#39;s the .nw, that needs to be the actual project
directory contents, not a directory containing them.</p>
<p><code>console.log</code> redirects to dev tools (same with console.warn and console.error)</p>
<p>the <code>process</code> object:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>process.versions[&#39;node-webkit&#39;]</code> is set with nw&#39;s version<ul>
<li><code>process.versions[&#39;chromium&#39;]</code> is set with the chromium version that the nw version is based on (so, for example, node-webkit version 0.13.0-alpha7, chromium version 47.0.2526.73, node version 5.1.0)</li>
<li><code>process.mainModule</code> is set to the <em>start</em> page, eg <code>index.html</code>--this is whatever&#39;s under <code>main</code> in the package.json, UNLESS there&#39;s a specified <code>node-main</code> field there.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p><code>__dirname</code> can only be called by node modules (with <code>require()</code>). webkit doesn&#39;t have that (not in devtools either). a hacky fix:</p>
<p><code>exports.dirname = __dirname</code> in a file, then require that (eg <code>var dirname = require(&#39;./dirnamefile&#39;).dirname; console.log(dirname)</code> would return dirname).</p>

<h1 id="misc-node-things">MISC NODE THINGS</h1>
<p>What the hell is an event emitter, anyway? Oh, okay. So. Here&#39;s an example.
<code>net.Server</code> emits an event when a peer connects. <code>fs.readStream</code> emits an event
when a file is opened. <code>events.EventEmitter</code> objects! This can be accessed
directly by requiring <code>events</code>.</p>
<p>Functions can be executed when an event is emitted--these are called
<strong>listeners</strong> (not something silly like emitter methods or whatever, that would
just be nonsense). In those functions, <code>this</code> is the <code>EventEmitter</code> to which the
listener is attached.</p>
<p>Something worth noting: <em>HANDLE EVENTEMITTER ERRORS</em>. Errors are special events
in node, and if there&#39;s no listener for it, node&#39;ll just print a stack trace and
exit. So always always always be aware, and do something like <code>.on(&#39;error&#39;, fn)</code>
to make sure you&#39;re handling errors the way you <strong>want</strong> to handle them, rather
than just letting shit crash and die.</p>

<p>Clearly that doesn&#39;t include <code>.pipe()</code>, but pipe isn&#39;t exactly an api thing I
think. It&#39;s a pipe. That&#39;d be like saying &#39;oh yeah, you need to learn |, that&#39;s
a really important thing&#39; or whatever. Sure, it&#39;s the most vital and fundamental

<p>React things:</p>

<p><code>shouldComponentUpdate(object nextProps, object nextState)</code> optimize rendering, return false if no need to update.</p>
<p><code>componentWillUpdate(same as above, there ^^ )</code> triggered after shouldEtc,etc..., and before <code>render()</code>.</p>
<p><code>compnentDidUpdate()</code> after rendering. Modify the DOM here.</p>
<p><code>componentWillUnmount()</code> just before component unmounted from DOM--do cleanup here.</p>
<p><code>displayName</code> good for debug especially. ES6 classes, derived from class name.</p>
<p><code>getInitialState()</code> equivalent of constructor in classes.</p>

<p>Eslint would be better for React, especially because of <code>eslint-plugin-react</code>.
Eslint also has autofixing (--fix) for some stuff.</p>
<p>With eslint we&#39;d just include that as an npm script, eg <code>npm run lint</code> with
<code>&quot;lint&quot;: &quot;eslint . --ext .js --ext .jsx --fix&quot;</code>.</p>
<p>Eslint also follows an <code>.eslintignore</code>, and an <code>.eslintrc</code>. Rules have
<em>severity</em>: 0 for disabled, 1 for warning, 2 for error. Some rules take an
<em>array</em> instead, like <code>&quot;quotes&quot;: [2, &quot;single&quot;]</code>.</p>
<p>When there&#39;s a lint error with Eslint, npm will give you an <code>ELIFECYCLE</code> error.
To hide that, we could do <code>npm run lint --silent</code>; alternatively, the same npm
script above could have <code>|| true</code> appended, but if we invoke that from somewhere
else, it&#39;ll pass even when there are failures.</p>
<p><code>jscs</code>, with <code>jscs-loader</code>, follows <code>.jscsrc</code>.</p>
<p>And, lastly, there&#39;s always EditorConfig and the <code>.editorconfig</code> file.</p>

<p>Flux: really just an architecture pattern that means it has a <em>unidirectional

<p>Some React Vocab:</p>
<p>As of some...time, <em>all</em> React custom components <em>must</em> be Uppercase, like This,
to differentiate from standard xml/html. See <a href="https://gist.github.com/sebmarkbage/f1f4ba40816e7d7848ad">this
gist</a> for more info on
that.</p>
<p>There are five main types in React (and that&#39;s a horrible word to use, can we
think of something better? Kinds of elements? Things? Idk...).</p>
<p>React Elements are the primary... thing. A <code>ReactElement</code> has four properties:
type, props, key, ref. No methods, nothing on prototype. Created like <code>var foo =
React.createElement(&#39;div&#39;).</code> You pass these to <code>React.render</code>, with a DOM element
(HTML or SVG), like <code>React.render(foo, document.body)</code>. To add properties to it,
pass a properties object as the second argument. Children to the third. (Note
that if using JSX, that&#39;s a bit less verbose.</p>
<p><code>ReactElement</code>-<em>factory</em> is a function that generates <code>ReactElement</code> with
specific <code>type</code> property. <code>function createFactory(type){return
React.createElement.bind(null, type)}</code>; <code>var div = React.createFactory(&#39;div&#39;);
var foo = div({className: &#39;my-div&#39;}); React.render(foo, document.body)</code>. Common
HTML tags have built-in factories in React (like <code>var quux = React.DOM.ul</code> or
<code>var bar = React.DOM.li</code>). But, again, JSX negates the need for factories.</p>
<p><code>ReactNode</code> could be <code>ReactElement</code>, string, number, or array of ReactNodes
(<code>ReactFragment</code>). This is a property of other <code>ReactElement</code>s used to represent
children. Kind of basically create a tree of REs.</p>
<p><code>ReactComponent</code> would be where the real meat of React can be found. Here we can
create whatsits in React, and then sort of encapsulate them with their own
little embedded <em>state</em>. And remember, in React, everything is state. And
everything is a really ugly bit of PHP that wants to be Javascript. So, <code>var
thingy = React.createElement(SomeComponent)</code> or <code>var thingy = &lt;Some Component
/&gt;</code></p>

<p>A transpiler is a compiler. It takes code that can&#39;t be run on whatever engine
it&#39;s targetting, and compiles it so it works. The only actual difference is that
when funky-code-X is compiled into normal-code-Y, it stays at around the same
level of abstraction. So, turning JSX or ES6 into ES5 doesn&#39;t really make a vast
difference in terms of performance, and it&#39;s not like Javascript is a low-level
language that we&#39;re compiling to, using Babel--we&#39;re just basically
cross-piling. Hence the &#39;trans&#39; prefix.</p>

ENTRYPOINT [<span class="hljs-string">&quot;node&quot;</span>] <span class="hljs-comment"># thing to run when we start the image, i think</span></code></pre><p>and then we do something like <code>docker build -t whatwewanttocallit .</code></p>
<p>and then <code>docker run -d 4010:4010 whatwecalledit</code></p>
<p>It looks like the <code>argon:node</code> image is one that is a thing. Nodejs.org recommends it.</p>
<p>Some other Dockerfile commands (?):</p>
<pre class="hljs"><code><span class="hljs-built_in">WORKDIR</span> <span class="bash">/<span class="hljs-built_in">set</span>/working/directory/to/here/i/guess
</span><span class="hljs-built_in">COPY</span> <span class="bash">thisthing /to/here

</span><span class="hljs-built_in">ADD</span> <span class="bash">. . <span class="hljs-comment"># add files/dirs from cwd to image</span></span></code></pre><p>The <code>-d</code> in <code>docker run -d</code> means <code>detach</code>. And <code>-p</code> as in <code>docker run -p 80:4010</code> looks obvious.</p>
<p>Some commands:</p>
<pre class="hljs"><code>docker ps <span class="hljs-comment"># get container id</span>
docker logs containerid
docer exec -<span class="hljs-keyword">it</span> containerid /bin/bash <span class="hljs-comment"># enter the container</span></code></pre><p>It&#39;s totally fine to test against ports from a container (with eg <code>cURL</code>).</p>
<p>There&#39;s also a <code>node:versionnumber</code> image I think?</p>
<p>To get non-root users: <code>RUN groupadd -r app &amp;&amp; useradd -r -g app app</code>,
then when the image is run, do it with <code>-u &quot;app&quot;</code>.</p>
<p>To limit usage: <code>-m &quot;256M&quot; --memory-swap &quot;2G&quot;</code></p>
<p>An example:</p>
<pre class="hljs"><code>docker run \
-<span class="ruby">e <span class="hljs-string">&quot;NODE_ENV=production&quot;</span> \
</span>-<span class="ruby">u <span class="hljs-string">&quot;app&quot;</span> \
</span>-<span class="ruby">m <span class="hljs-string">&quot;256M&quot;</span> --memory-swap <span class="hljs-string">&quot;2G&quot;</span> \
</span>-<span class="ruby">w <span class="hljs-string">&quot;/web/jane-com/app&quot;</span> \
</span>-<span class="ruby">-name <span class="hljs-string">&quot;jane-com&quot;</span> \
</span>node index.js</code></pre><p>Installing (on nix): <code>curl https://get.docker.com/ | sh</code></p>
<p>Installing test version: <code>curl https://test.docker.com | sh</code></p>
<p>Installing dev version: <code>curl https://experimental.docker.com | sh</code></p>
<p>Compose is like fig, but from Docker.</p>
<pre class="hljs"><code>pip <span class="hljs-operator"><span class="hljs-keyword">install</span> -U docker-compose
docker-compose up -<span class="hljs-keyword">d</span>
docker-compose <span class="hljs-keyword">stop</span>, <span class="hljs-keyword">kill</span>, rm</span></code></pre><p>All of these just go off a YAML file, I guess.</p>
<p>Okay, based on Node&#39;s official docs we can do:</p>
<pre class="hljs"><code>FROM <span class="hljs-keyword">node</span><span class="hljs-identifier"></span><span class="hljs-title">:6</span>.<span class="hljs-number">2.0</span>
EXPOSE <span class="hljs-number">4010</span>

<span class="hljs-comment"># and then</span>

docker build -t jane-com .
docker run -it --rm -name jane-com-docker-running jane-com</code></pre><p>To keep Docker running, throw this in your bash rc: <code>eval $(docker-machine env default)</code></p>
<p>And if you need systemd in the mix, try something like:</p>
<pre class="hljs"><code><span class="hljs-comment">;; once docker is installed, there should already be</span>
<span class="hljs-comment">;; a systemd service for it. so you can just systemctl start docker</span>

<p>Doing an <code>export</code> piped to an <code>import</code> essentially works like a squash, flattening all the layers,
so extraneous info (for example, creating files that later get removed) wouldn&#39;t take up extra space.</p>
<p><code>docker export</code> is for <em>containers</em>, currently running.</p>
<p><code>docker save</code> is for <em>images</em>.</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Barbara:</p>
<ul>
<li>Networking events matter.</li>
<li>Barbara from DM2 ended up as the only actual webdev at her company</li>
<li>This kinda means she&#39;s got to be everything from junior dev to PM</li>
<li>Definitely don&#39;t be self-deprecating about stuff.</li>
<li>Express interest outright in companies/their products.</li>
<li>Yeah, sure, don&#39;t talk yourself <em>up</em> too much, but seriously, communicate
well about what you&#39;ve actually managed to do, because they want to know.</li>
<li>Know why it is that a company makes the choices it does. Barbara&#39;s
example: knowing why it was the company she works for uses Angular.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>Mark:</p>
<ul>
<li>Having past projects to talk about <em>really</em> helps. Obviously. Duh.</li>
<li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Situation,_Task,_Action,_Result">STAR</a> is a thing,
and maybe I should actually know what that is, I guess?</li>
<li>This is basically a totally disheartening little talk. What?</li>
<li>They asked him to rewrite his whole project in Scala. I&#39;m confused about what
this guy is actually even talking about. What is this?</li>
<li>His experience is basically one of being put through hell to get in with
some SAAS analytics-analytics company (yes, that&#39;s correct, his company
analyses analytics).</li>
<li>Actual takeaways: go to meetups, network with people, and talk about <em>why</em>
you actually want to be doing this.</li>
<li>Trying out actual interviews (like, with companies where it may or may not
ever happen, but basically you&#39;re not really counting on that working out
anyway) can be a lot more helpful than just going over responses on your own
or in an absolutely-no-pressure kind of situation.</li>
<li>Oh, wait, okay. As depressing as his little bit was, the actual point of it
is this: jump through the hoops, because it&#39;ll probably be worth it. Maybe
the company will pay you for your work on the project (I mean, that&#39;s kinda
becoming normal now, anyway). Maybe they won&#39;t -- and if they don&#39;t, use that
project or whatever on your portfolio.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>Dallin:</p>
<ul>
<li>He likes whatever it is that he does now, I guess.</li>
<li>He has &#39;come to realise more, the many fallacies in his personality.&#39;<ul>
<li>Yay?</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>I don&#39;t know that he has any actual advice. Besides, basically, just kinda
don&#39;t be like him, because he&#39;s more about learning from mistakes than just,
like, maybe, not trying to make as many.</li>
<li>He said a lot of other things but I was too busy being really annoyed with
the damned profiles.devmounta.in project to take any other notes.<ul>
<li>Seriously, it wouldn&#39;t kill people to check pull requests before making
huge commits. I give up.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Dallin learned Ruby in a week between getting hired and actually starting work.
That&#39;s pretty cool. He works mostly in Rails, and I know he does Coffeescript,
so chances are he learned that on the job (knowing Ruby definitely would&#39;ve
helped with that).</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>Jeff:</p>
<ul>
<li>Don&#39;t make portfolio pieces that aren&#39;t accessible.<ul>
<li>Example: his Instagram analytics site.</li>
<li>If this isn&#39;t possible, do a video demo of that project.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>

<p>Finally.</p>
<p>As always, don&#39;t take this stuff too seriously, there&#39;s a fair chance a lot of
it is not correct, and any opinions have most likely changed maybe probably
sortakinda.</p>
<p>These last bits are in chronological order of file modification date. I believe
this was from during the second week of Angular.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="angular">ANGULAR</h2>
<p>so, <code>expressions</code>, basically that&#39;s why we&#39;re gonna be mashing those braces
constantly. it&#39;s kind of like inline scripts, but minus the script tags?</p>
<p><code>directives</code> are the powerful bit. jqueryish dom extension? apparently something
we&#39;ll use a lot is <code>ngRepeat</code>, which, if it means writing less html, is a-ok
with me.</p>
<pre class="hljs"><code><span class="xml"><span class="hljs-tag">&lt;<span class="hljs-title">div</span>&gt;</span>
  <span class="hljs-tag">&lt;<span class="hljs-title">div</span> <span class="hljs-attribute">data-ng-repeat</span>=<span class="hljs-value">&quot;user in users&quot;</span>&gt;</span>
  <span class="hljs-tag">&lt;<span class="hljs-title">h4</span>&gt;</span></span><span class="hljs-expression">{{<span class="hljs-variable">user.name</span>}}</span><span class="xml"><span class="hljs-tag">&lt;/<span class="hljs-title">h4</span>&gt;</span>
  <span class="hljs-tag">&lt;<span class="hljs-title">p</span>&gt;</span></span><span class="hljs-expression">{{<span class="hljs-variable">user.properties</span>}}</span><span class="xml"><span class="hljs-tag">&lt;/<span class="hljs-title">p</span>&gt;</span>
  <span class="hljs-tag">&lt;/<span class="hljs-title">div</span>&gt;</span>
<span class="hljs-tag">&lt;/<span class="hljs-title">div</span>&gt;</span></span></code></pre><p>so it&#39;s like how python folks write python everything, including html; we&#39;re
writing javascriptish markup! it makes sense in those terms. that snippet there
just created that same div for each user in users; say we have several user
objects, it&#39;ll just go right ahead and repeat that markup per user.</p>
<p><code>ngShow</code> determines if an element should be shown or not, based on a boolean.</p>
<pre class="hljs"><code><span class="xml"><span class="hljs-tag">&lt;<span class="hljs-title">div</span> <span class="hljs-attribute">data-ng-repeat</span>=<span class="hljs-value">&quot;pizza in boxes&quot;</span> <span class="hljs-attribute">data-ng-show</span>=<span class="hljs-value">&quot;pizza.topping == &#39;peppers&#39;&quot;</span>&gt;</span>

<span class="hljs-tag">&lt;/<span class="hljs-title">div</span>&gt;</span></span></code></pre><p>guess what. your gross-ass hawaiian pie? not in those divs, no sir.</p>
<p><code>ngSwitch</code> OHH THIS IS USEFUL. we could&#39;ve used this last week.</p>
<pre class="hljs"><code><span class="xml"><span class="hljs-tag">&lt;<span class="hljs-title">div</span> <span class="hljs-attribute">data-ng-switch</span>=<span class="hljs-value">&quot;pizza.photo&quot;</span>&gt;</span>

<span class="hljs-tag">&lt;/<span class="hljs-title">div</span>&gt;</span></span></code></pre><hr>
<p>directives straight up from angular are all named <code>ngSomethingStuff</code>; they&#39;re
used like &quot;ng-something-stuff&quot; (or &quot;data-ng-something-stuff&quot;) in view. they can
also be comments (?), dom elements, or CSS classes (oh hai jquery what up).</p>
<p>one could use &#39;operations&#39; within those little handlebars up there (i believe
we&#39;re calling those <code>expressions</code>, and <code>operations</code> would be our word for
executable snippets, basically?). so <code>{{pizzza.beInMe()}}</code> is totally valid.</p>
<p><code>ngModel</code> to create two-way data-binding.</p>
<p>aaaaand i do believe this example just literally piped a username to uppercase.
OKAY. <code>{{name | uppercase}}</code> that is, apparently, called a <code>filter</code>, though in
the interest of correctness (and also just to irk ryan :P) i&#39;ll keep calling
them pipes, thank you very much.</p>
<p>hmm. it would seem the guy who wrote this intro to angular is either getting
paid by google, or currently sitting on someone&#39;s dick there... some of the
worship is just a wee bit too cloying for real life.</p>
<p><code>ngApp</code> is the directive to include a partial (to bind an application, in the
parlance). <code>ngView</code> to actually use it.</p>
<p><code>.config</code> does (whodathunkit) configuration, basically by d i (?). you <em>could</em>
pass a function with parameters named after what you&#39;re sourcing that way, but
it&#39;s not good practice (actually, i hadn&#39;t thought about that before... what
happens to variables by the time they&#39;ve been through minification, base62, and
gzip? ⊙▃⊙). instead, you should use an array with the names of the elements that
should get all shot up in your page, because, y&#39;know, ain&#39;t no one messing with
your actual data.</p>
<p><code>routes</code> are a big deal, from what i hear. here&#39;s a simple one from this guy&#39;s
blog post:</p>
<pre class="hljs"><code>angularStuff.config([<span class="hljs-string">&#39;$routeProvider&#39;</span>, <span class="hljs-keyword">function</span>(<span class="hljs-variable">$routeProvider</span>) {
  <span class="hljs-variable">$routeProvider</span>.when(<span class="hljs-string">&#39;/objects&#39;</span>, {
        templateURI : <span class="hljs-string">&#39;view/objects.html&#39;</span>
    , controller  : <span class="hljs-string">&#39;ObjCtrl&#39;</span>
    }).otherwise({templateURI : <span class="hljs-string">&#39;view/NOPE.html&#39;</span>})
}])</code></pre><p>please forgive me, but i need to take a minute to say some things that should be
obvious.</p>
<p>yes, this way of working with partials and configs is pretty sweet, but let&#39;s be
honest, here, and very straightforward: partials and templating systems and
whatnot exist solely for the purpose of making things <em>easier</em> on the people
doing the programming. somehow i feel like going with even more nested
punctuation is more of an exercise in concrete poetry than a highly advanced and
developed javascript framework. ugh.</p>
<p><code>.controller</code> is, like, what you use for controllers. <code>$scope</code> links your
controllers and their bound views. (?) (or binded, if you&#39;re this fellow.)</p>
<pre class="hljs"><code>angularThang.controller(<span class="hljs-string">&#39;BTCtrl&#39;</span>, [<span class="hljs-string">&#39;$scope&#39;</span>, <span class="hljs-keyword">function</span> (<span class="hljs-variable">$scope</span>) {
  <span class="hljs-variable">$scope</span>.objects = [{
    key  : <span class="hljs-string">&#39;value&#39;</span>
  , next : <span class="hljs-string">&#39;another&#39;</span>
  },{
    key  : <span class="hljs-string">&#39;let\&#39;</span>s do it again<span class="hljs-string">&#39;
  , next : &#39;</span>okay, now we\<span class="hljs-string">&#39;re done&#39;</span>
  }]
}])</code></pre><p><code>$watch</code> calls a listener for a controller on an attribute of its scope (oh boy,
pronouns, this is fun). <code>$broadcast</code> will trigger an event on a scope, which&#39;ll
be transmitted to that scope, and <em>all</em> of its children. to trigger a global
even, you&#39;d use <code>$rootScope</code>. without copying down every example from this
rather crudely typed out blog post, we&#39;re basically using
<code>$scope.$watch(stuff)</code>, <code>$scope.$broadcast</code>, <code>$scope.$on</code> etc. so, y&#39;know. extra
<code>$$$$$$$$</code> for everyone.</p>
<p>obviously <code>services</code> are gonna be my favourite toy here. there&#39;s an <code>$http</code>
builtin! (i think... as mentioned, this blogger is probably better at writing
code that writing words, so... i don&#39;t really know). so you can inject them (oh
geez, really? we&#39;re going with &#39;inject&#39; here? we couldn&#39;t&#39;ve said &#39;require&#39; or
&#39;load&#39; or some other generic and often used term that could maybe be <em>slightly</em>
less confusing in this context?) into your controllers and whatnots and
fiddlybits, straight up. same goes for custom
services/external/third-party/whatever, i suppose. basically you&#39;ve just got to
have some sort of usable api there for other services &amp; fiddlywhatnots to
access.</p>
<p><code>$http</code> is a thin wrapper on XHR; <code>$resource</code> is higher level (though without
any examples of how, all i have to go on is that you can call POST something
like &#39;save&#39; and get something like &#39;GIMME DAT&#39; or whatever... so... what?). and
i think <code>$resource</code> is <em>not</em> a builtin, because you&#39;d need to have a dependency
on <code>ngResource</code> to use it. and here he says we&#39;ve got <code>$httpBackend</code> built in to
test without a web server, but he doesn&#39;t mention if that&#39;s actually a builtin
or a core module that would need to be required, nor does he mention whether or
not it runs a webserver itself or just sends out a fake packet, internally, or
whatever.</p>
<hr>
<p>so, jeremy&#39;s super-boiled-down 10-second run-through of the MVC pattern
definitely clarified the actual role of the controller. i mean, i kind of
understood that it&#39;s basically binding models and views, but never really
understood it as the actual middleman until just now. that is awfully sensible.</p>
<p>implied, but not stated explicitly: react is less of a bottleneck as a view than
angular is.</p>
<p>something to keep in mind: <code>$scope</code> is straight up two-way binding, not sortof
or sometimes as was implied in the article.</p>
<p>oh, <code>directive</code> is basically just silly slang for attributes.</p>
<p>mismatched bits and bobs? not with angular, it&#39;ll just boink up some fresh new
dom nodes for your loose-ends</p>
<p>$timeout basically same syntax as setTimeout, except</p>
<pre class="hljs"><code><span class="hljs-variable">$timeout</span>(<span class="hljs-keyword">function</span>(){
  <span class="hljs-variable">$scope</span>.thing = <span class="hljs-string">&#39;that&#39;</span>
}, <span class="hljs-number">10000</span>)</code></pre><p>EVEYTHING that goes IN the html that angular will use is INSIDE of
ng-controller, attached to its $scope</p>
<p>so for the  HTML to even give a crap about what&#39;s going on in your javascript,
it&#39;s gotta be in a $scope. everything that you want angular to actually act on
had better be {{}} in the html and $scope in your js</p>
<p>as jeremy explained it, your js as it sits in your files is ALSO basically kind
of a starting point, because (and see 1.md for more notes on triggering events),
what angular does is (he said scan for but i understood it as wait for triggers
from) basically an excuse to go changing things. so your objects, variables,
whatever are OH MY GOD NOW I KNOW WHAT IMMUTABLE JAVASCRIPT IS A BIG DEAL OKAY
(no, not because of angular, but because it just hit me how how loose EVERYTHING
can really be in javascript... wow, no wonder js get so much hate. it probably
deserves it.)</p>
<p>ng-repeat makes a miniature scope for the foo part of <code>ng-repeat=&quot;foo in bar&quot;</code>
-- underneath, i suppose. that&#39;s super slick.</p>
<pre class="hljs"><code>&lt;input ng-model=<span class="hljs-string">&quot;someFilter&quot;</span>&gt; <span class="hljs-comment">// filter is a keyword to angular, it knows to look for a filter as defined by itself</span>
&lt;<span class="hljs-keyword">div</span> ng-repeat=<span class="hljs-string">&quot;some in such | filter: someFilter&quot;</span>&gt;
{{some.stuff}} {{some.things}} <span class="hljs-comment">// okay, and i suppose, it looks like filter is just a builtin that does just that one</span>
{{some.stuff}} {{some.things}} <span class="hljs-comment">// exact thing... it only shows the thing that you&#39;re inputting/providing as a filter</span>
{{some.stuff}} {{some.things}} <span class="hljs-comment">// BUT that does not necessarily have to mean actual filtered string fragments.</span>
{{some.stuff}} {{some.things}} <span class="hljs-comment">// THIS MAKES LIFE EASY.</span>
&lt;/<span class="hljs-keyword">div</span>&gt;
&lt;<span class="hljs-keyword">div</span> ng-repeat=<span class="hljs-string">&quot;some in such | filter: { name: someFilter location { name: locationNameFilter } }&quot;</span>&gt;
<span class="hljs-comment">// so basically we&#39;re interactively filtering here, but also filtering by the type of whatchamacallits,</span>

really, basically, we&#39;re just going over use-cases and examples now. which is totally fine,
of course.</p>
<p>note that when we go ahead and send a buncha chained promises, we&#39;re gonna get stuff back
however it comes back, not in the order we started things. we&#39;d want to sort things after,
if needed, not (obviously) within promises, because that would make all of that redundant;
we&#39;d basically be using promises to run some synchronous javascript, at that point.
dumb.</p>

<p>don&#39;t take anything here seriously. i think it&#39;s just interesting to reread
my initial reaction when i was confronted with everything that is react.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="react-meetup-17-nov-2015">React Meetup, 17 Nov, 2015</h2>
<p>React:</p>
<ul>
<li>Good at managing state.</li>
<li>which is to say, dynamism</li>
<li>Components, just like... everything else these days, so that&#39;s totally irrelevant.</li>
<li>virtual dom, which is not exactly facebook&#39;s anyway.</li>
<li>unidirectional data flow, which is a mouthful.</li>
<li>that is, the loop.</li>
<li>more boilerplate to run that... less boilerplate-replacer built into react?</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<p>Random-ass notes and stuff.</p>
<p>Erm. Thus far, it&#39;s web architecture 101. Components are a thing. People don&#39;t
like to refresh whole pages. Etc.</p>
<p><code>render() == render: function(){}</code></p>
<p><code>this.setState</code> = important, should always use</p>
<p>React is a view. But, does server-side rendering. Which is much more up my
alley, because it&#39;s not making life miserable for users. We can check that out
when we check out all those other frameworks, for fun.</p>
<p>React is compiled.</p>
<p>Redux is a state container. Which actually makes sense now. Because everything
is state, in React, it seems. So, it abstracts state and manages it
independently from the front-end, which is how React <em>can</em> do it&#39;s thing on the
server.</p>
<p>My god, though, React people are worse than Lisp people. Everything has to be
about how they do things better, even when they very clearly just do things at a
totally okay level.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.quora.com/React-JS-Library/How-was-the-idea-to-develop-React-conceived-and-how-many-people-worked-on-developing-it-and-implementing-it-at-Facebook">OH. It turns out that React looks like PHP to be because it was influenced by XHP</a>.
Which is PHP, influenced by E4X (ECMAScript with random XML all up in it). So
React is Javascript based on PHP based on Javascript based on XML. So it&#39;s
totally okay to think that it&#39;s hideous. That&#39;s good.</p>

is gui related, found a lot of other stuff about that that had nothing to do with actually crashing.
anyway, the thing that actually ended up working was:</p>
<p><code>sudo &quot;/Applications/Parallels Desktop.app/Contents/MacOS/inittool&quot; init -b &quot;/Applications/Parallels Desktop.app&quot;</code></p>
<p>note: run that as sudo from your normal user, don&#39;t <code>sudo su</code> and then do it.</p>
<p>after that, i just opened parallels again and it worked. so. idk. no issues since.
if anyone else can&#39;t get anything to work, maybe that&#39;ll help.</p>

<p>a whole bunch of basically totally disorganised notes from when i was working
on my &#39;personal project&#39; at devmountain.</p>
<p>this was meant to be a sort of ghost/medium for the desktop -- a blogging platform
for people who actually cared about writing. turns out no one really wants that.
also it turns out <a href="https://github.com/TryGhost/Ghost-Desktop">ghost was working on a desktop application</a>
cool.</p>
<p>requirements for this: make a mean stack app, basically.</p>
<p>anyway <a href="https://github.com/zacanger/ayuba">this is the remains of that poor app i built</a>
and more importantly here&#39;s the mess of notes i took while doing stuff with that.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="planner">Planner</h2>
<p>At DevMountain, for projects, you&#39;re encouraged (required, really) to use a planning
paper, which is basically a big sheet of paper divided up into sections that represent
pieces of a standard MEAN-stack app, and a sort of roadmap-to-an-end-product thing along
the bottom.</p>
<p>I was actually out sick the day those got handed out for the personal projects, but NBD,
there was a PDF version floating around so I threw a little app up using that (converted to
PNG and colour-inverted) using a little bit of PHP and jQuery to make a kind of sticky-notes
bulletin-board kind of thingy to serve the same purpose. One benefit of this is that I was
able to easily just save all my notes out (they were all just in a big text file anyway, on
my server). Note: I&#39;d initially planned on using my earlier app from my &#39;no-server&#39; project
(something we do at DevMountain early on, just an Angular app that can actually use a server
so long as it&#39;s a BaaS and not one we&#39;ve spent time doing, because we don&#39;t actually know how
to do that at that point) called <a href="https://github.com/zacanger/markvi">markvi</a>.</p>
<p>Anyway, these are the contents from my planning thing.</p>
<h3 id="ideas-and-users">Ideas and Users</h3>
<p>concept: a blogging platform <em>for writers, and readers</em>, based not around the
ADHD social media style of content-creation and likes and shares that&#39;s taken
over the popular idea of the blog, but instead around long-form writing; essays,
meaningful stories, and such. the target audience here is the moderately
technically savvy pseudo-bohemian; 25-50, used to smoke cloves, probably hangs
out in coffee shops too much.</p>
<h3 id="features">Features</h3>
<ul>
<li>mvp: oh wait, that&#39;s already done. well, except for getting it to work in the
desktop client, which is the entire idea here.</li>
<li>the rest:<ul>
<li>a clean, simple &#39;feed&#39; (a la jekyll archive pages), filterable by tag and possibly date.</li>
<li>comments.</li>
<li>import/export without relying on the browser (to markdown and html).</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="views">Views</h3>
<ol>
<li>the existing markdown editor (however, likely revamped to move away from
plain old codemirror, and to include a basic rte-style toolbar).</li>
<li>the rendered panel, alone (the reading view; same on one&#39;s own posts as
someone else&#39;s).</li>
<li>the &#39;social&#39; view: a feed, no &#39;content-based&#39; sorting, just purely ordered
chronologically, and filterable by tag (and POSSIBLY date range).</li>
<li>-ish?: comments. they&#39;ll be isolated (data-wise), so it may be smarter to
load them in dynamically (see: discourse [not discuz, they&#39;re ruby], but don&#39;t
do that stupid thing where half the page disappears, that&#39;s some annoying-ass
bullshit).</li>
<li>settings. VERY simple. name, email, password, export (if possible) to an
archive file, delete account.</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="controllers">Controllers</h3>
<ul>
<li>browser, main, and nav (see existing codebase)</li>
<li>not controllers, but...</li>
<li>services: files (existing)</li>
<li>filters: filename and cut (existing)<ul>
<li>by tag (feed view)</li>
<li>(also possibly by date -- narrowing -- feed view)</li>

<p>this would be relatively easy to throw up in a web browser. blogging platforms
are a dime a dozen, especially ones built on node. the idea here isn&#39;t to make
another tumblr, but to bring actual writing back to the web. sort of like
medium, but without all the twitter. a key part of that is having it NOT be in a
browser. right now the goal is to put all this in an electron shell, but i&#39;m not
going to focus super hardcore on that right this moment. if i can get everything
else in place and rock-solid first, then i&#39;ll stuff it all in electron. if not,
then i&#39;ll just write up a manifest file and call it a chrome app. either way,
fuck y&#39;all, it&#39;s already got nigh on a thousand installs....</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="the-presentation-speech">The Presentation Speech</h2>
<p>This is what I&#39;d planned to say when presenting my app. I think instead
I just kind of mumbled a little bit about how neat CodeMirror is and how
annoying it was to struggle with the <code>&#39;node-integration&#39;</code> issue with
Electron.</p>
<h3 id="markdown">Markdown</h3>
<p>…is a lightweight markup language which makes writing for the web a much quicker
and easier process than if using a rich text editor (like Word), which wouldn&#39;t
translate to HTML anyway, or writing HTML manually. Intead of <code>&lt;em&gt;</code> or
<code>&lt;strong&gt;</code>, in Markdown you&#39;d use a <code>_</code> or <code>*</code>, or <code>__</code> or <code>**</code>. Readme files on
Github are usually written in an implementation of Markdown called Github
Flavoured Markdown, which shows just how popular the format has grown. Stack
Overflow, the Discourse comment system, and various blog systems including
Ghost, Wordpress, Tumblr all use Markdown, if not by default than as an option.</p>
<p>vi is possibly the most influential editor of, like, ever. it was written in
1976, and either vi or one of its descendants (usually vim, which stands for &#39;vi
improved&#39;) has been on almost every unix-based system since then, including
every computer in this building (except the microsoft machines -- and even on
those, if you have git-bash or something similar). vim&#39;s power comes from how
easily and quickly it can manipulate large chunks of text. For example, typing
in <code>d5k</code> will delete five lines upwards, and<code>497G</code> jumps to line 497.</p>
<p>So, putting these things together makes for a really great tool for writing. Not
necessarily writing Tweets or Facebook posts, but writing longer texts, like
articles or essays. That&#39;s the purpose of this app. It&#39;s not a social blog. It&#39;s
kind of like Medium minus Twitter, Tumblr minus reblogging, or LiveJournal
minus… teenagers.</p>
<p>Since the editor component itself is based around CodeMirror, it&#39;s very
extensible, which is exciting because it leaves so much open for future
development. For example, if we wanted to make this a Javascript editor instead,
we could just change a few lines and now we have the right syntax highlighting,
automatic indentation, et cetera.</p>
<p>Oh, and, so, this is all a desktop app. It runs perfectly fine in a browser, but
from the beginning it was really meant to be a desktop tool; browsers are
distracting, this not so much.</p>
<p>Aaaand here&#39;s the code.</p>

<h2 id="misc-notes">misc notes</h2>
<p>All this stuff was just thrown in another file.
It&#39;s mostly to do with <a href="https://electron.atom.io">Electron</a>, I think.</p>
<p>check <a href="https://github.com/atom/electron/blob/master/docs%2Fapi%2Fbrowser-window.md">https://github.com/atom/electron/blob/master/docs%2Fapi%2Fbrowser-window.md</a>
before trying to get any other browser-shit going on--we&#39;ll want to move things
into their own windows, i feel; chromeless might be a good idea, at least for
the editor view</p>
<pre class="hljs"><code>const BrowserWindow = <span class="hljs-function"><span class="hljs-title">require</span><span class="hljs-params">(<span class="hljs-string">&#39;electron&#39;</span>)</span></span><span class="hljs-class">.BrowserWindow</span>
let win = new <span class="hljs-function"><span class="hljs-title">BrowserWindow</span><span class="hljs-params">({width : <span class="hljs-number">1900</span>, height : <span class="hljs-number">1600</span>, frame : false})</span></span></code></pre><p>so basically it&#39;s just a new browser window, frame as false, but we want to
probably lock the px to whatever screen we&#39;re working with, if CSS continues to
fail miserably.</p>
<p>-- note: check how atom manages to not fuck that up. except those bits where
they do.</p>
<p>frameless = non-draggable (even with alt?). specify <code>-webkit-app-region: drag</code>
in css. or, say, <code>body { -webkit-app-region: drag }</code> for all of that. this
necessitates <code>button { -webkit-app-region: no-drag }</code> (same for non-button
clickables, one assumes).</p>
