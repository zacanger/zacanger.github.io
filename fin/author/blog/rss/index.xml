with it. I put together a repo a while ago for that, full of examples and notes.
Check it out <a href="https://github.com/zacanger/es6-and-builds/tree/master">here</a>.
(Also if you want, check out my semi-maintained bunch of examples and resources
for learning React <a href="https://github.com/zacanger/react-bits">here</a>.)</p>
<hr>
<p><code>react-redux</code> (not a part of Redux itself, since it&#39;s supposed to be
framework/library agnostic... ish) is something you&#39;ll need for writing React
apps using Redux. It sort of enforces the presentational/container (or
dumb/smart) way of structuring your components.</p>
<p>Note&mdash;you don&#39;t <em>need</em> <code>react-redux</code> to be able to use Redux with React, it
just helps. A lot.</p>
<p>I won&#39;t go into the whole presentational/container component thing, there are a
lot of blogs posts and such out there on that topic, but it&#39;s basically what it
sounds like; you have components that handle how things look and components that
handle how things work.</p>
<p><code>react-redux</code> gives you this <code>connect()</code> function which is pretty handy. You can
do a lot of the stuff it does by hand using <code>store.subscribe()</code>, but then you
start needing to worry about <code>shouldComponentUpdate</code> and all this stuff, and
it&#39;s all kind of annoying.</p>
<p>When wrapping a &#39;dumb&#39; component up in a &#39;smart&#39; component, there are two
functions you usually throw in there. One is called <code>mapStateToProps</code>, and the
other is <code>mapDispatchToProps</code>. I&#39;d suggest you take a good look at the <a href="https://github.com/reactjs/react-redux">official
docs</a> on <code>react-redux</code> to get a good
feel for how it all works, but setting up a container component turns out to be
pretty straightforward.</p>
<pre class="hljs"><code><span class="hljs-keyword">import</span> { connect } <span class="hljs-keyword">from</span> <span class="hljs-string">&#39;react-redux&#39;</span>
<span class="hljs-keyword">import</span> { someReducer } <span class="hljs-keyword">from</span> <span class="hljs-string">&#39;./wherever/your/reducers/are&#39;</span>
<span class="hljs-keyword">import</span> AComponent <span class="hljs-keyword">from</span> <span class="hljs-string">&#39;./AComponent&#39;</span>

<span class="hljs-keyword">const</span> mapStateToProps = (state, ownProps) =&gt; ({
  <span class="hljs-attribute">somethingInState</span>: someReducer(state, ownProps.maybeSomeProperty.Here)
})

<span class="hljs-keyword">const</span> mapDispatchToProps = (dispatch, ownProps) =&gt; ({
  <span class="hljs-attribute">something</span>: probablyAnActionOrOtherFunction
})

<span class="hljs-keyword">const</span> AComponentThatIsNowConnected = connect(
  mapStateToProps
, mapDispatchToProps
)(AComponent)

<span class="hljs-keyword">export</span> <span class="hljs-keyword">default</span> AComponentThatIsNowConnected</code></pre><p><code>mapDispatchToProps</code> is a little tricky, so I&#39;d really suggest just checking out
<a href="https://github.com/reactjs/react-redux/blob/master/docs/api.md">the docs</a>.</p>
<p>There&#39;s one other important bit, and that&#39;s this thing called <code>Provider</code>. It&#39;s a
component that makes the store available to all your container components
without you needing to actually pass it down everywhere. It uses this funky
<a href="https://facebook.github.io/react/docs/context.html">context</a> thing under the
hood. You don&#39;t need to put it everywhere, you just wrap a root component in it.</p>

bits of my own (admittedly limited) personal experience with Redux into a
couple of blog posts.</p>
<hr>
<p>All your data moves in one direction. This is the same as in Flux. You will
always go through the same steps in redux:</p>
<ul>
<li>Action (call <code>store.dispatch()</code> with an object that describes something
happening)</li>
<li>Reducer (pure function called based on the action that was dispatched that
calculates next state)</li>
<li>Your root reducer combines a bunch of reducers&#39; outputs into one state tree
(assuming you have a root reducer, which you probably do)</li>
<li>The store saves the state tree as returned by the above&mdash;now that&#39;s your
state (and at this point anything you subscribed with will be invoked)</li>
</ul>
<p>All your state in redux is just an object&mdash;just one object. It&#39;s probably a
good idea to try to keep that as shallow as possible, and reference things by
keys (IDs), rather than deeply nesting stuff.</p>
<p>Reducers are just functions. They take your existing state (state previous to
acting on it) and an action and output state (new state).</p>
<pre class="hljs"><code>const someReducer = <span class="hljs-function"><span class="hljs-params">(oldState, action)</span> =&gt;</span> newState</code></pre><p>It&#39;s a reducing function just like you&#39;d pass to <code>Array.reduce()</code>, it it should
always be a pure function. Don&#39;t mutate arguments, call non-pure functions, make
API calls, or anything like that in a reducer. If you don&#39;t know what a pure
function is, it&#39;s actually super simple:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Given the same arguments, a pure function will always have the same output.
This means it&#39;s a function who&#39;s result relies solely on its arguments.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>One thing you should get in the habit of doing is using &#39;default arguments.&#39;
This is new in ES2015, and saves you a bit of code. This means you could have
some initial state:</p>
<pre class="hljs"><code>const initState = {
  <span class="hljs-string">something     :</span> <span class="hljs-string">&#39;a&#39;</span>
, <span class="hljs-string">somethingElse :</span> <span class="hljs-string">&#39;b&#39;</span>
}</code></pre><p>And instead of needing to write</p>
<pre class="hljs"><code>const reducer = (<span class="hljs-keyword">state</span>, action) =&gt; {
  if (typeof <span class="hljs-keyword">state</span> === &#39;undefined&#39;) {
    return initState
  }
  // do stuff
}</code></pre><p>You can just do</p>
<pre class="hljs"><code>const reducer = (<span class="hljs-keyword">state</span> = initState, action) =&gt; // do stuff</code></pre><p>Reducers are frequently switch statements. This might seem a little weird at
first, since most JS folks avoid switch statements (I think some linters even
warn about them, saying they&#39;re &#39;confusing&#39;), but it makes sense in reducers
since you can handle various actions in one function. Remember, an action is
just an object: <code>{type: &#39;do_thing&#39;}</code> with possible other fields: <code>{type:
&#39;do_thing&#39;, to: &#39;stuff&#39;}</code>.</p>
<pre class="hljs"><code>const someReducer = (<span class="hljs-keyword">state</span> = initState, action) {
  switch (action.type) {
    case do_stuff:
      return Object.assign({}, <span class="hljs-keyword">state</span>, {something: action.<span class="hljs-keyword">to</span>})
    <span class="hljs-keyword">default</span>:
      return <span class="hljs-keyword">state</span>
  }
}</code></pre><p>Note the <code>Object.assign()</code>&mdash;we don&#39;t mutate state, we return a new state
based on the old state and the action. You&#39;ll probably want to use a polyfill
for <code>.assign()</code>, but chances are you&#39;re already using Babel anyway. You could
also use something from Lodash, Underscore, or some other library.</p>
<p>It&#39;s always a good idea to return <code>state</code> (which is our old state) as a default,
in case we get sent some unexpected action.</p>
<p>It&#39;s also a good idea to split your reducers and compose them:</p>
<pre class="hljs"><code>const firstReducer = (<span class="hljs-keyword">state</span> = {}, action) =&gt; {
  switch (action.type) {
    case something:
      return stuff
    <span class="hljs-keyword">default</span>:
      return <span class="hljs-keyword">state</span>
  }
}

const secondReducer = (<span class="hljs-keyword">state</span> = initState, action) =&gt; {
  switch (action.type) {
    case whatever:
      return firstReducer(<span class="hljs-keyword">state</span>.field, action)
    <span class="hljs-keyword">default</span>
      return <span class="hljs-keyword">state</span>
  }
}</code></pre><p>This means that <code>firstReducer</code> only needs to get the state that it actually
cares about, when it needs to do something. Also note that defaut state is an
empty object there. It could be anything you want it to be, just make sure it&#39;s
the shape your reducer expects to act on.</p>
<p>When you have a lot of reducers, you can use <code>combineReducers</code>:</p>
<pre class="hljs"><code><span class="hljs-literal">import</span> { combineReducers } from <span class="hljs-string">&#39;redux&#39;</span>

<span class="hljs-keyword">const</span> lotsOfReducers = combineReducers({
  firstReducer
, secondReducer
<span class="hljs-comment">// , etc.</span>
})

<span class="hljs-literal">export</span> <span class="hljs-keyword">default</span> lotsOfReducers</code></pre><p>And you can do this as many times as you like, in as many files as you need.</p>
<p>All you&#39;re doing with reducers is taking in the state as it exists, taking in an
action, and outputing the new state. What you&#39;re operating against is the store.</p>
<p>The Store is a really important bit. It holds all the state of your app. This
is different from Flux, where you&#39;d have a lot of little stores. In Redux
there&#39;s only one. It&#39;s accessed similiarly&mdash;you have <code>getState()</code>, you
dispatch actions, and you can have listeners subscribe to changes. To create a
store in Redux, you just use <code>createStore</code>.</p>
<pre class="hljs"><code><span class="hljs-literal">import</span> { createStore } from <span class="hljs-string">&#39;redux&#39;</span>
<span class="hljs-literal">import</span> someReducer from <span class="hljs-string">&#39;./someFile&#39;</span>
<span class="hljs-keyword">const</span> store = createStore(someReducer)
<span class="hljs-comment">// createStore can take your initial state, too</span>
<span class="hljs-keyword">const</span> store = createStore(someReducer, initialState)
<span class="hljs-comment">// and for creating a store as simply as possible (mocking in testing, etc.):</span>
<span class="hljs-keyword">const</span> store = createStore(() =&gt; ({})) <span class="hljs-comment">// your store is just an empty object, now</span></code></pre><p><code>store.subscribe()</code> returns a function for _un_subscribing. So you can do
something like:</p>
<pre class="hljs"><code>const unsubscribe = store.<span class="hljs-function"><span class="hljs-title">subscribe</span><span class="hljs-params">(someListener)</span></span>
<span class="hljs-function"><span class="hljs-title">unsubscribe</span><span class="hljs-params">()</span></span></code></pre>]]></description><link>/2016/redux-two.html</link><guid isPermaLink="true">/2016/redux-two.html</guid><category><![CDATA[redux]]></category><dc:creator><![CDATA[zac anger]]></dc:creator><pubDate>Sat, 06 Aug 2016 14:37:00 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[redux notes, part one]]></title><description><![CDATA[<p>Because the Redux docs say &quot;Redux is actually really simple!&quot; when sometimes

<hr>
<p>The store is an object that holds state. There&#39;s only ever one store in Redux,
with many reducers that act on it.</p>
<p><code>getState()</code> returns the state from the store.</p>
<p><code>subscribe(listener)</code> says &quot;Hey, call <code>listener</code> when the state changes.&quot;</p>
<p>There&#39;s also a <code>replaceReducer</code> but unless you&#39;re writing hot middlware or
something you probably won&#39;t touch this one.</p>
<p>State can by any type, though obviously it&#39;s probably best to just use an
object here.</p>
<p>Actions are always objects, and they always have a <code>type</code>.</p>
<pre class="hljs"><code>store.<span class="hljs-function"><span class="hljs-title">dispatch</span><span class="hljs-params">({type: <span class="hljs-string">&#39;do-stuff&#39;</span>})</span></span>

store.<span class="hljs-function"><span class="hljs-title">dispatch</span><span class="hljs-params">({type: <span class="hljs-string">&#39;DO_OTHER_STUFF&#39;</span>, stuff: <span class="hljs-string">&#39;[things to do here, maybe]&#39;</span>})</span></span></code></pre><p>Action creators are functions that create actions based on any sorts of
arguments.</p>
<pre class="hljs"><code><span class="hljs-title">const</span> sendSomeData = &#39;send-some-<span class="hljs-typedef"><span class="hljs-keyword">data</span>&#39;</span>
<span class="hljs-title">const</span> sendSomeDataActionCreator = <span class="hljs-typedef"><span class="hljs-keyword">data</span> =&gt; <span class="hljs-container">({
  <span class="hljs-title">type</span> : <span class="hljs-title">sendSomeData</span>
, <span class="hljs-title">data</span>
})</span></span></code></pre><p>A &#39;bound&#39; action creator would be one that creates the action and immediately
dispatches it. This might be familiar to folks who&#39;ve worked with Flux before.</p>
<p>This is how you might have something like this in Flux:</p>
<pre class="hljs"><code><span class="hljs-keyword">const</span> sendMoreData = data =&gt; {
  <span class="hljs-keyword">const</span> doIt = {
    type : sendMoreData,
    data
  }
  dispatch(doIt)
}</code></pre><p>And this is how it&#39;d work in Redux:</p>
<pre class="hljs"><code><span class="hljs-comment">// assuming you already have the dispatch and action creator, you&#39;d just</span>
const boundSendMoreData = data =&gt;
  <span class="hljs-function"><span class="hljs-title">dispatch</span><span class="hljs-params">(sendMoreData(data)</span></span>)</code></pre><p>There&#39;s also a <code>bindActionCreators()</code> to just do this for you, and React-Redux
has <code>connect()</code>.</p>
<p>Async actions should go through middleware to be turned into regular actions
before being dispatched.</p>
<p>Reducers always take state and an action and return state.
<code>reducer (state, action) =&gt; state</code>
These are what they sound like&mdash;reducing functions.
The state a reducer takes is your existing (or previous, I guess) state.
Reducers are pure functions.</p>
<p>A dispatch is a function that takes an action (or an async action). It may then
dispatch an action (or actions) which will affect the store.
There&#39;s a base <code>dispatch</code> that always sends an action to the reducer.</p>
<p>Middleware are about what you&#39;d expect&mdash;functions (HOF) that take a
dispatch function and return a dispatch function.</p>
<p>There are &#39;store enhancers&#39; that are higher-order functions that take a store
creator and return a different store creator. They&#39;re basically kind of a
middleware for the store creator. You probably won&#39;t directly use one, ever.
Instead you&#39;ll just use the regular store creator (<code>createStore</code>).</p>

kinda gross to think about you know so unless we&#39;re doing something
like making ten million objects just use a factory there i guess</p>
<p>streams are functors</p>
<p>functors are just a thing that implements map</p>
<p>monads are functors that also implement <em>flatMap</em></p>
<p>flatMap just flattens, i guess? that&#39;s what it sounds like.</p>
<p>so like with Promises for example, <code>.then</code> is like <code>.flatMap</code>.
same with stuff like bind and chain methods and stuff. it&#39;s basically
flattening into its <em>value</em> rather than having the actual (semi-expected)
value (function/promise/stream/whatever).</p>
<p>so if you have a flatMap that would return another monad, i guess,
it&#39;d actually return its value, not that other monad.</p>
<p>if you are a tooling addict, don&#39;t do tools. (this actually totally applies to
me, because i&#39;ve spent more time on <a href="https://github.com/zacanger/z.git">my dotfiles</a>
than on any other individual project... <em>but</em> i feel like it&#39;s worth it, mostly.
being able to just use vim and not go through the work of setting up any other
editor on any computer, being able to just clone that repo and symlink what i need,
that really does make me more productive. as long as i don&#39;t forget how to use
computers without my dotfiles, i don&#39;t think they&#39;re really a waste of time.)</p>

<h2 id="three-quick-tips-for-succeeding-at-a-bootcamp">Three Quick Tips for Succeeding at A Bootcamp</h2>
<p>I recently graduated from DevMountain, a 12-week immersive web development
bootcamp with campuses in Provo, Salt Lake, and Dallas. I had an overwhelmingly
positive experience, and I landed a great job soon after graduation. So for me,
the bootcamp was a good choice. I&#39;ve noticed this disparity, though, between
people who attend bootcamps and have a positive experience, and people who have
a negative one. Oftentimes this negativity is caused by inability to find a job
after finishing up a bootcamp.</p>
<p>Here are three tips to help you end up in the column of success stories.</p>
<h3 id="enjoy-what-you-do">Enjoy What You Do</h3>
<p>Perhaps this sounds obvious, but I was surprised about how many people signed up
to go to a bootcamp without having any idea of whether or not they liked
programming. Some people are lured in by the prospects of landing a shiny new
job, and I get that. It&#39;s a tempting idea. But, if you don&#39;t enjoy what you&#39;re
doing, it&#39;s going to be very hard to succeed. Even if you can get through the
bootcamp and land a job, why would you want to start a career doing something
you don&#39;t enjoy? I spent several months teaching myself to code before going to
the bootcamp, so by the time the first day of class came around, I already had a
healthy enjoyment for programming.</p>
<h3 id="set-yourself-apart">Set Yourself Apart</h3>
<p>In a nutshell, the way I landed my job was by learning and doing something that
almost nobody in my cohort did. I learned ReactJS, which was not taught heavily
as curriculum at the time I attended DevMountain. Really diving into React on my
own enabled me to contribute to some open source components at MX (a startup in
Utah). When I applied for the apprenticeship at MX, they received a slew of
other talented applicants, but I was able to land the job. This was largely due
to the fact that they had a rapport with me via back-and-forth communication in
pull requests, and my open source contributions gave them confidence I could
contribute to their codebase. There are a lot of ways to set yourself apart -
learn something different, build something different, contribute to open source,
etc. Find something that interests you and dive in.</p>
<h3 id="make-connections">Make Connections</h3>
<p>I prefer the phrase make-connections over &#39;network&#39;. I hate the idea of
business-type-people mingling over cocktails and that&#39;s what I used to think of
when I heard the word network. What I&#39;ve found though, is making connections
doesn&#39;t have to be uncomfortable. Twitter can be an extremely useful tool for
chatting with prominent developers in your area, and you can also ask them an
occasional question. So not only can you make connections and form
relationships, but also you can get some help from experts in the field. Forming
relationships on twitter enabled me to speak at my first meetup.</p>
<p>Twitter isn&#39;t the only way to have success with this. I&#39;ve connected with people
over linkedin and in person as well. Find what works for you. One last tip on
this - it&#39;s a lot easier to network when you <em>arent</em> desperate for a job. When
you reach out to someone while you&#39;re looking for a job, no matter how well your
intentions are, it might come across like you&#39;re looking for a handout. I
addressed this by networking very early in the bootcamp, so the pressure of
finding a job was lifted.</p>
<p>This isn&#39;t a ground breaking list of tips, but I was surprised to see people who
failed to do one or multiple of these things. Give it a go, and I wish you the
best of luck in your new journey as a developer!</p>

<li>abstract <em>above</em> just a normal directory tree for navigation/code organization !!</li>
</ul>
<p>!! -- almost certainly only through extensibility (packages/plugins), and even then these are pretty far-out goals,

<p>It&#39;s pretty simple. Shouldn&#39;t be too hard to grasp, maybe a little harder to
implement.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Have confidence in your code.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>If you don&#39;t have confidence in your code, then try this:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Write code in which you have confience.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It really sucks to have to walk someone through your  code when you&#39;re not
sure it&#39;s even doing the things it&#39;s supposed to do, or when you <em>are</em> sure
it&#39;s doing the right things but doing them in a really gross kind of way.</p>
<p>I think this is something everyone struggles with. It&#39;s really easy to copy
and paste stuff from StackOverflow, and everyone does it for a while. I still
do it sometimes, though usually with a lot of testing and reading before
actually running that code.</p>
<p>It&#39;s really easy, as a new dev, to say &quot;Well, I don&#39;t know how to do that thing,
can you just show me?&quot; And that&#39;s okay, but it&#39;s a lot more okay to say &quot;Hey,
I spent an hour with the docs, here&#39;s my implementation, here&#39;s the stack trace
and I couldn&#39;t find anything helpful on the source&#39;s issues or SO, do you have
any ideas?&quot;</p>
<p>It takes a while to write code that you don&#39;t hate, but usually even someone
who&#39;s been programming for a few months knows what good code looks like. It&#39;s
concise, readable, logical, and consistent. It doesn&#39;t make you cringe.</p>
<p>I&#39;m not really very good at writing code and feeling great about it. When it
comes to, say, raw Node or a Bash script, I&#39;m usually better with these things
than anyone I know on a personal level, and have no problem taking charge and
just doing things. But when it comes to the things I actually do every day
(which right now means React, Koa, AWS stuff, Docker, trying to read C#, and
Sass, mostly) I know I&#39;m not that great. Knowing that I&#39;m not that great means
I take probably twice as long as I would to get anything done as I would if I
was the best at that thing in the room, because I know people who know more
than I do will be looking at my code and will need to fix it.</p>
<p>That&#39;s not a <strong>bad</strong> thing, but it&#39;s not a good thing either. It means I&#39;m
programming without confidence, when I&#39;m writing React or Sass. And I&#39;m not
even <em>bad</em> at either, I just have no confidence when writing these things
on a project with people who are better at them than I am. That&#39;s something
that I should get over.</p>
<p>Anyway, I meant to write this post on the train and post it when I got home,
but I ended up standing on the train so it&#39;s split, from while waiting for the
train &#39;til 10:30 PM while sitting at DevMountain, so it&#39;s probably a little
disjointed.</p>
<p>The point here is, if you have confidence in what you&#39;re doing, you&#39;ll get
stuff done quicker and better, and if you don&#39;t have confidence in what you&#39;re
doing, make it so that you can.</p>
