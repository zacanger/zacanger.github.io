<p>Notes taken while watching <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLwuUlC2HlHGe7vmItFmrdBLn6p0AS8ALX">this series</a>.</p>
<h2 id="contracts">Contracts</h2>
<p>Basics of type checking.</p>
<pre class="hljs"><code><span class="hljs-keyword">const</span> str = a =&gt; {
  <span class="hljs-keyword">if</span> (<span class="hljs-keyword">typeof</span> a !== <span class="hljs-string">&#39;string&#39;</span>) <span class="hljs-keyword">throw</span> <span class="hljs-keyword">new</span> <span class="hljs-built_in">TypeError</span>(<span class="hljs-string">&#39;Expected a string&#39;</span>)
  <span class="hljs-keyword">else</span> <span class="hljs-keyword">return</span> a
}</code></pre><h2 id="guarded-functions-and-categories">Guarded Functions and Categories</h2>
<p>Functions that have contracts on input or output are called <em>guarded</em> functions.</p>
<p>An <em>any</em> function might just look like an identity function (<code>const any = a =&gt; a</code>).</p>
<p>Maps between categories are functors.</p>
<p>The <em>objects</em> of categories are the <em>contracts</em>. <em>Morphisms</em> are the (guarded) functions.</p>
<p>Function that returns a contract:</p>
<pre class="hljs"><code><span class="hljs-keyword">const</span> typeOf = type =&gt; a =&gt; {
  <span class="hljs-keyword">if</span> (<span class="hljs-keyword">typeof</span> a !== <span class="hljs-string"><code>&lt;span class=&quot;hljs-subst&quot;&gt;${type}&lt;/span&gt;</code></span>) <span class="hljs-keyword">throw</span> <span class="hljs-keyword">new</span> <span class="hljs-built_in">TypeError</span>(<span class="hljs-string"><code>Expected &lt;span class=&quot;hljs-subst&quot;&gt;${type}&lt;/span&gt;!</code></span>)
  <span class="hljs-keyword">else</span> <span class="hljs-keyword">return</span> a
}</code></pre><p>And basic usage:</p>
<pre class="hljs"><code>const bool = <span class="hljs-function"><span class="hljs-title">typeOf</span><span class="hljs-params">(<span class="hljs-string">&#39;boolean&#39;</span>)</span></span>
const num  = <span class="hljs-function"><span class="hljs-title">typeOf</span><span class="hljs-params">(<span class="hljs-string">&#39;number&#39;</span>)</span></span>
<span class="hljs-comment">// etc.</span>
<span class="hljs-comment">// Obviously, for arrays you&#39;d need to use Array.isArray()</span></code></pre><p>Then we could do something like</p>
<pre class="hljs"><code>const increment = <span class="hljs-operator">a</span> =&gt; {
  <span class="hljs-operator">a</span> = <span class="hljs-built_in">num</span>(<span class="hljs-operator">a</span>)
  <span class="hljs-constant">return</span> <span class="hljs-operator">a</span> + <span class="hljs-number">1</span>
}</code></pre><p>Before I go further I should mention that yes, I have heard of Flow and TypeScript.</p>
<pre class="hljs"><code>const increment = (<span class="hljs-tag">a</span>: number) =&gt; <span class="hljs-tag">a</span> + <span class="hljs-number">1</span></code></pre><p>I assume this video series will get to actual type systems at some point, though
it was made before TypeScript and Flow were written, so it won&#39;t be mentioning those.</p>
<h2 id="array-contracts">Array Contracts</h2>
<p>Not using <code>isArray</code> or <code>instance of</code>. Using <code>toString</code>.</p>
<pre class="hljs"><code><span class="hljs-keyword">const</span> arr = a =&gt; {
  <span class="hljs-keyword">if</span> ({}.toString.call(a) !== <span class="hljs-string">&#39;[object Array]&#39;</span>) <span class="hljs-keyword">throw</span> TypeError(<span class="hljs-string">&#39;Expected array!&#39;</span>)
  <span class="hljs-keyword">else</span> <span class="hljs-keyword">return</span> a
}</code></pre><p>The same thing could be done for <code>Date</code>, <code>RegExp</code>, etc.</p>
<h2 id="functors">Functors</h2>
<p>Takes a maps the contract over the things array. Will throw if they&#39;re not all
correct. Ensure that your array is, for example, all Strings, or whatever.</p>
<pre class="hljs"><code>const arrayOf = contract =&gt; things =&gt; <span class="hljs-function"><span class="hljs-title">arr</span><span class="hljs-params">(things)</span></span>.<span class="hljs-function"><span class="hljs-title">map</span><span class="hljs-params">(c)</span></span></code></pre><p>This acts on the category&#39;s <em>objects</em> and <em>morphisms</em> both, and produces new
objects and new morphisms.</p>
<h2 id="maybe">Maybe</h2>
<p>The <em>Maybe</em> functor.</p>
<p><code>Maybe</code> is a Monad, but I guess we&#39;re only thinking of its Functor-ness for this
video?</p>
<p>Anyway here&#39;s some code.</p>
<pre class="hljs"><code><span class="hljs-keyword">const</span> Maybe = () =&gt; {}

I started there just over a year ago,
and when I finished the course I worked there as a mentor for a cohort (three
months). Immediately after that, I got what I think is a pretty swell job doing
development full time, working mostly in technologies that I really like.</p>
<p>It&#39;s hard to find non-success stories from bootcamps, since generally the people
who go to these things are people who are really determined to do very well. You
don&#39;t go and pay $10k-$20k to lock yourself up in a building with a bunch of
other nerds for twelve or moure hours every day for three months straight unless
you really want to get something out of it. I think I&#39;m a good example of
someone who did really well through a bootcamp, though, and the reason I did so
well comes down to really just one thing, which I think everyone going into
computing (whether it&#39;s web development, databases, hardware, whatever) really
should be aware of.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>KNOW COMPUTERS</p>
</blockquote>
<p>That seems really obvious, right? But as a mentor it was amazing to me how many
people would come into a course that&#39;s just about making things happen with
computers, not knowing a lot of the basics of how to <em>use</em> a computer, and
knowing virtually nothing about how computers actually <em>work</em>. They&#39;re not just
a thing with a keyboard and a screen and a logo on the back. They&#39;re not just a
status symbol, though Mac users would like you to think they are. They&#39;re not
magical, and it&#39;s important to know what they do and how they do it, at least in
vague terms.</p>
<p>No junior web dev should really be expected to be familiar with what a page
cache is, or maybe even how domain names are resolved, but you should at least
know what a kernel is, what userland actually means, what the implications of
using your particular filesystem are, what the internet infrastructure kind of
looks like (at least in vague terms), and how to do some basic things that will
save you a lot of time later on (general terminal usage is a good place to
start).</p>
<p>This is the number one thing that can help you get, and stay, ahead as a student
and junior dev, in my opinion. And it&#39;s stuff you&#39;ll absolutely <em>have</em> to know
at some point, and probably mostly won&#39;t be taught, so it&#39;s a good idea to just
pick up this stuff as early as possible.</p>

<a href="https://twitter.com/zacanger/status/796205243474157569">tweet</a> from last night.</p>
<p>I was born male, and I identify as male. That&#39;s pretty convenient for me.
I&#39;m white, which is probably very convenient for me.
I make a conscious effort to be aware of my privilege, but I probably fuck up
sometimes. I hope that whenever that happens, someone will call me out on it.</p>
<p>I was born in Baltimore, and went to a public school that I think was less than
half white. That turned out to be a nice thing, because I never really
understood what the big deal was about skin colour. My parents tell me I
literally didn&#39;t understand that some people might think there was a difference
between people with different coloured skin. And why would I? I was a kid,
that&#39;s not a thing I should have to know.</p>
<p>My family moved to southern Pennsylvania when I was 11. South-Central PA is
overwhemingly white, and has a large boomer population. One could easily go
months at a time without seeing a black person, especially if one was
homeschooled (which I was, because the local schools were some of the worst in
the state).</p>
<p>When I was 19, I was working in the coffee shop in a local grocery store. I had
just voted for the first time. Obama became President. The next morning, I went
to work around 6:30, sold a newspaper to an older guy around 7. He sat down on a
nearby bench and said to me &quot;Can you believe they put a n----- in the White
House?&quot; This wasn&#39;t my first time encountering racism, but it was the first time
I realised just how open people in that area were about it.</p>
<p>I worked at a guitar shop for a while. The guy who owned it was a stereotypical
redneck, something straight out of a Far Side comic. To him, anyone non-white
was nothing but an epithet, women existed to be objectified, and if he got a
hint that someone wasn&#39;t straight, they wouldn&#39;t be allowed in his shop. Most of
his days were spent smoking pot and looking at pictures of girls on the computer
in his office.</p>
<p>I moved to Utah about a year ago. I didn&#39;t intend to stay here, because Utah is
all of the bad things people say about it. It&#39;s also all of the good things
people say about it&mdash;there are mountains and things, and if you&#39;re into
that that&#39;s pretty nice&mdash;but it&#39;s extremely white, extremely Mormon,
extremely dry, and extremely boring. It&#39;s a lot of the things I hated about
Pennsylvania, except drier and with Mormons instead of Evangelicals.</p>
<p>I kind of thought, though, that being out here would be a bit of an escape from
the &#39;culture&#39; in Pennsylvania. James Carville
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pennsyltucky">described PA</a> as being Philadelphia
and Pittsburgh with Alabama in between, and that&#39;s pretty accurate. Utah&#39;s more
like Salt Lake City and then a bunch of nothing mixed with Mormons, which isn&#39;t
actually any better. Mormons are a little more laid-back about their racism and
mysogyny, but it&#39;s still there. They&#39;re just encouraged not to show it off,
because the LDS church doesn&#39;t want that public image. It&#39;s pretty clear based
on their politics, though.</p>
<p>This election was not about anything except for hatred. A common statement is
that Trump just &#39;tells it like it is,&#39; but that&#39;s known to be bullshit. He&#39;s
been the most dishonest Presidential candidate in the history of fact-checking,
and Clinton has been one of the most factually accurate, ever, period. Straight
talk has nothing to do with anything. There have also been numbers that say that
Trump supports think the economy will do better under Trump, but generally folks
actually worried about the economy will vote Democrat, probably because the
economy tends to do better under Democrats.</p>
<p>Trump winning the electoral vote last night has nothing to do with policy. It
was a message from the worst kind of people in this country that they want to be
heard and want to be taken seriously. That they&#39;re afraid of people who don&#39;t
look like them or have the same beliefs as them. People like that old man at the
coffee shop, or Randy from the guitar shop, or Carmine, my boss at my last job
in Pennsylvania. People who think they should have the right to openly
discriminate against other people, people who are so unconcerned with facts that
they sound exactly like characters in Idiocracy (link), calling people &#39;faggot&#39;
for being educated on a topic.</p>
<p>I&#39;m a cis white male, and I&#39;m sorry that a bunch of cis white males did this to
this country. It&#39;s going to be really rough, especially at first when we have a
red house and senate. We, collectively, all the people that have fought for
LGBTQA rights and less discrimination and tried to defend against ignorance and
won Clinton the popular vote, we need to hold on and survive this and support
each other. We need to call each other out on our biases and abuse of
privilege We need to not give up. We need to show each other, the country, and
the world that America is not a country of hate.</p>
<p>There are folks on Twitter saying that this will be easy, that love and
happiness and just get through it, and that&#39;s bullshit. This won&#39;t be easy. This
is serious and dangerous and terrifying. This is bad news all around. But let&#39;s
try, because we can&#39;t all just leave.</p>

<p>First: a less intrusive type annotation thing for JS. It&#39;d be similar to ML or
Haskell style annotations, but maybe use Flow as a sort of backend to actually
do the type checking? It could look something like this:</p>
<pre class="hljs"><code>//<span class="hljs-type-annotation">::</span> <span class="hljs-built_in">Int</span> -&gt; <span class="hljs-built_in">Int</span> -&gt; [<span class="hljs-built_in">Int</span>]
<span class="hljs-keyword">const</span> putIntsInList = (a, b) =&gt; [ a,  b ]

//<span class="hljs-type-annotation">::</span>Str -&gt; Str -&gt; Str // or
//<span class="hljs-type-annotation">::</span>[<span class="hljs-built_in">Char</span>] -&gt; [<span class="hljs-built_in">Char</span>] -&gt; [<span class="hljs-built_in">Char</span>]
<span class="hljs-keyword">const</span> doThingsWithStrings = (a, b) =&gt; <span class="hljs-string"><code>${a} ${b}</code></span></code></pre><p>It could use some sort of regexy thing to basically just detect anywhere there&#39;s
<code>//::</code>, see what the next thing is, and see if they go together. I don&#39;t know
much about ASTs or type systems, though. I just think that&#39;d be a lot less
in-the-way than how TypeScript and Flow currently work. Also, my syntax
highlighting doesn&#39;t know what template strings are, so. That&#39;s gross.</p>
<p>Another thing:</p>
<pre class="hljs"><code><span class="hljs-keyword">import</span> React, { PropTypes } from &#39;react&#39;
<span class="hljs-keyword">import</span> AnotherComponent from &#39;./AnotherComponent&#39;

const <span class="hljs-type">Something</span> = ({ a, b, <span class="hljs-built_in">c</span> }) =&gt; {
  <span class="hljs-keyword">if</span> (!a) <span class="hljs-keyword">return</span> null

  <span class="hljs-keyword">return</span> (
    (div
      (another-component (whatever &#39;a))
        (not (null? b)
          (span (b))
        (not (null? <span class="hljs-built_in">c</span>)
          (<span class="hljs-built_in">map</span> (p (<span class="hljs-built_in">c</span>)))))))
  <span class="hljs-comment">// which would be like</span>
  <span class="hljs-keyword">return</span> (
    &lt;div&gt;
      &lt;<span class="hljs-type">AnotherComponent</span> whatever={a} /&gt;
      {b &amp;&amp; &lt;span&gt;{b}&lt;/span&gt;}
      {<span class="hljs-built_in">c</span> &amp;&amp; <span class="hljs-built_in">c</span>.length &amp;&amp;
        <span class="hljs-built_in">c</span>.<span class="hljs-built_in">map</span>((a, i) =&gt; &lt;p key={i}&gt;{a}&lt;/p&gt;)
      }
    &lt;/div&gt;
  )
}

export <span class="hljs-keyword">default</span> <span class="hljs-type">Something</span></code></pre><p>This a totally made-up syntax for a thing that doesn&#39;t exactly exist, and I
don&#39;t know how useful this would actually be, since there are already great
React libraries for ClojureScript out there. Just think it&#39;d be neat to be able
to to JSX in Scheme. I dunno, just a thought.</p>

This isn&#39;t news. They <em>can</em> help
other people be more aware of what you&#39;re doing, which is generally a good thing
(collaborating on projects, managers keeping track of progress, whatever), but
overdoing it with the tools can be seriously detrimental to actually getting
anything done.</p>
<p>I was going to write a much longer post about this, but let me just give you a
list of all things I check several times a day (in the case of Slack, several
times an hour), instead.</p>
<ul>
<li>Wrike (a task/project management thing with the worst UI of any like tool on
the market)</li>
<li>Trello (not so much anymore, but some people still use it at work, apparently)</li>
<li>Quip (a weird combination of Trello and Excel)</li>
<li>Github Issues/PRs (Issues not so much anymore, though that would be the most
sensible place to keep track of repo-specific todos)</li>
<li>And of course, Slack</li>
</ul>
<p>Personally I keep track of what I need to do in two places: for personal items,
a JSON file (yes, a JSON file). This means I can use it with my little
<a href="http://npmjs.com/package/lilnote">command-line note-taking app</a>, easily work
with it in any language, whatever. For work tasks, I just keep a giant Markdown
file, using GFM-style task lists. I end up copying things over from one or more
of the above tools into Markdown, where I keep track of them for hours or days
or weeks, then as things are fleshed out, completed, nixed, or whatever, going
back to those tools (usually more than one) to update them.</p>
<p>This is not an efficient workflow. Some of these tools (Quip and Wrike
especially) are so lacking in all the things that make a good project management
app (mainly, simplicity and ease of use) that using them ends up taking more
than half as much time as many of the small tasks.</p>
<p>The last place I worked, we switched to this thing called Droptask. It was so
bad, such a ridiculously complicated UI mess, that myself and some co-workers
just ended up not using it at all, and relied solely on Slack. Picking a (one,
singular) decent tool really makes a difference. Trello&#39;s popular because it&#39;s
simple and easy. For devs, same goes for Issues.</p>
<p>I meant to write a good bit more about this but I probably don&#39;t need to.
Everyone complains about using too many tools all the time, especially devs
using businessy tools. And it&#39;s late. So.</p>

It&#39;s also the old hotness.
It&#39;s just pretty hot, really. Everyone wants to have a more functional codebase,
and that&#39;s a good thing. Less side-effecty, easier to hold in your head, etc.;
the benefits of FP have been thoroughly espoused elsewhere. I just have a couple
of things to add about learning functional programming, especially if you&#39;re
coming from another paradigm or a mixed-paradigm language (like JS).</p>
<h2 id="you-probably-don-t-need-to-learn-another-language">You (Probably) Don&#39;t Need To Learn Another Language</h2>
<p>Languages like Haskell are really neat. They&#39;ll change the way you think about
writing code. But you don&#39;t need to learn a classically functional language to
learn functional programming.</p>
<pre class="hljs"><code><span class="hljs-module"><span class="hljs-keyword">module</span> Main <span class="hljs-keyword">where</span></span>
<span class="hljs-import"><span class="hljs-keyword">import</span> System.Environment</span>

<span class="hljs-title">main</span> :: <span class="hljs-type">IO</span> ()
<span class="hljs-title">main</span> = <span class="hljs-keyword">do</span>
  args &lt;- getArgs
  putStrLn (<span class="hljs-string">&quot;Hello &quot;</span> ++ args !! <span class="hljs-number">0</span>)</code></pre><p>If a block of code like that looks pretty foreign, that&#39;s okay. <em>You can program
functionally in whatever language is most familiar to you</em>. Probably. If you&#39;re
a C# dev or Rubyist or something, maybe you should look into something a little
less strictly OO, but if you already write JS (for example), you don&#39;t need to
go learn about abstract algebra and what stuff like <code>Foo :: [Bar] -&gt; Baz Quux</code>
means. Which leads into thought number two:</p>
<h2 id="a-better-type-system-doesn-t-make-a-language-functional">A Better Type System Doesn&#39;t Make A Language Functional</h2>
<p>Yeah, languages like Idris and Haskell and other super mathy things are great
for functional programming, but you don&#39;t <em>need</em> super complex type systems to
program functionally. They&#39;re just, y&#39;know, pretty nice. Look at
<a href="https://racket-lang.org/">Racket</a>, for example. You can have static typing
(with <code>#lang typed/racket</code>) but you don&#39;t <em>have</em> to. Similarly, you can program
functionally just fine in plain old JS, and you can write super imperative code
in TypeScript. My point is, type systems don&#39;t make a language more functional,
they make a language have a different type system.</p>
<h2 id="lots-of-languages-have-a-repl">Lots Of Languages Have A REPL</h2>
<p>LISP people like to talk about their REPL a lot. Same with Haskell folks,
they&#39;ll tell you to go experient in GHCI. That&#39;s great, it really is. The REPL,
for any given language, should be one of the primary tools you use to figure
things out. But most languages have one. If you do Python, you&#39;re probably
familiar with it. Same with Ruby (irb or pry). Node&#39;s REPL, while a little
limited compared to GHCI, is still pretty fantastic. Racket&#39;s is very basic, but
if you <code>(require xrepl)</code> it ends up being very pleasant. Having a decent REPL
isn&#39;t a functional language feature, it&#39;s just a language ecosystem feature.</p>
<h2 id="scheme-is-really-nice">Scheme Is Really Nice</h2>
<p>I&#39;m not a LISPer. I&#39;ve just started learning Racket, which I chose because it&#39;s
very compact compared to, say, ClojureScript (which also looks fantastic, by the
way). But coming primarily from JavaScript, Scheme (Racket is a Scheme) is a
really good way to get into FP in another language. Haskell, ML, Idris, etc.,
are all awesome languages, but Scheme might be a better way to break into
functional languages for a lot of folks. Give it a shot sometime.</p>

<p>What we&#39;re going to build this time is going to be a little more complex. We&#39;re
going to write a program that downloads a website and turns it into Markdown for
easy offline reading. This isn&#39;t a new concept, and I actually use a Python script
called <a href="https://github.com/aaronsw/html2text">html2text</a> for this on an
almost-daily basis, but just for fun, we&#39;ll do something similar in Node.</p>
<p>This will also be the first time we&#39;ll be working with external modules, which
is really the most exciting and awesome thing about Node.</p>
<p>Our goal here is to have a small tool we can use like this:</p>
<pre class="hljs"><code>./index<span class="hljs-class">.js</span> zacanger.com</code></pre><p>And it&#39;ll give us back the contents of <code>zacanger.com</code>, in Markdown, ready to
read in the terminal, pipe to an editor, or whatever.</p>
<p>First things first: we&#39;ll need a project. Make a new directory and get into it,
and <code>npm init</code>.</p>
<pre class="hljs"><code><span class="hljs-keyword">mkdir</span> html2txt
<span class="hljs-keyword">cd</span> html2xt
npm init -<span class="hljs-literal">y</span></code></pre><p>The <code>-y</code> flag just means &quot;don&#39;t ask me questions.&quot; You can skip that flag and
fill in the info for your <code>package.json</code> if you&#39;d like, or just go back and edit
it later.</p>
<p>We&#39;re going to be using a couple of things built-in to Node, so we can go ahead
and require them now. We&#39;ll need <code>http</code>&#39;s <code>get</code> method, and also a way to work
with an argument. If you&#39;ve done either of my previous tutorials, you&#39;ll already
be familiar with Node&#39;s <code>process.argv</code>.</p>
<pre class="hljs"><code><span class="hljs-keyword">const</span> { <span class="hljs-keyword">get</span> } = <span class="hljs-built_in">require</span>(<span class="hljs-string">&#39;http&#39;</span>)
<span class="hljs-keyword">const</span> url = process.argv[<span class="hljs-number">2</span>]</code></pre><p>Let&#39;s see if we can&#39;t get some HTML, just as a starting point.</p>
<pre class="hljs"><code>get<span class="hljs-list">(<span class="hljs-keyword">url</span>, res =&gt; {
  res.on<span class="hljs-list">(<span class="hljs-quoted">&#39;data</span>&#39;, d =&gt; {
    console.log<span class="hljs-list">(<span class="hljs-keyword">d</span>)</span>
  })</span>
  res.on<span class="hljs-list">(<span class="hljs-quoted">&#39;end</span>&#39;, <span class="hljs-list">()</span> =&gt; {
    console.log<span class="hljs-list">(<span class="hljs-quoted">&#39;done</span>&#39;)</span>
  })</span>
})</span></code></pre><p>Try that out with something like <code>node index.js http://google.com</code>.</p>
<p>You should see something like <code>&lt;Buffer 3c 21 64 6f 63 74 7</code> (and so on).
<a href="https://nodejs.org/api/buffer.html">Buffers</a> are great and all, but that&#39;s
pretty useless for actual reading. Try calling <code>toString</code> on that data and you
should see some actual HTML (<code>console.log(d.toString())</code>).</p>
<p>(Note: you may see a 301 page here.)</p>
<p>Awesome! We now have all the functionality of prepending <code>view-source:</code> to a URL
in the browser. Let&#39;s do something with that HTML, since it&#39;s probably not how
you prefer to read stuff.</p>
<p>There are a lot of great modules out there for working with Markdown. For this
post, I&#39;ve decided to go with a super simple one without a whole lot of options,
<a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/to-markdown">to-markdown</a>. If you&#39;re not super
familiar with npm, you&#39;re about to learn just about all you need to know to get
started.</p>
<p>In your terminal, <code>npm i -S to-markdown</code>. This is a shorthand for the command
<code>npm install --save to-markdown</code>; most npm commands have shorter versions, and
it can really save you a lot of time if you get used to using them.</p>
<p>You should see a bunch of stuff happen in the terminal. If you check your
<code>package.json</code>, you&#39;ll now see <code>to-markdown</code> in there. It should like something
like this:</p>
<pre class="hljs"><code><span class="hljs-collection">{
  <span class="hljs-string">&quot;name&quot;</span>: <span class="hljs-string">&quot;something&quot;</span>,
  // probably some other stuff
  <span class="hljs-string">&quot;dependencies&quot;</span>: <span class="hljs-collection">{
    <span class="hljs-string">&quot;to-markdown&quot;</span>: <span class="hljs-string">&quot;^3.0.1&quot;</span>
  }</span>
}</span></code></pre><p>(Yes, I know you can&#39;t have comments in JSON.)</p>
<p>Next we&#39;ll need to get that into the program. If you&#39;re using Babel, you can use
<code>import</code>, but to keep things simple we&#39;ll stick with <code>require</code>.</p>
<pre class="hljs"><code>const toMarkdown = <span class="hljs-function"><span class="hljs-title">require</span><span class="hljs-params">(<span class="hljs-string">&#39;to-markdown&#39;</span>)</span></span></code></pre><p>Now try running the HTML through this before logging it out.</p>
<pre class="hljs"><code><span class="hljs-comment">// ...</span>
<span class="hljs-keyword">const</span> toMarkdown = require(&#39;to-markdown&#39;)
<span class="hljs-comment">// ...</span>
  res.<span class="hljs-keyword">on</span>(&#39;data&#39;, <span class="hljs-keyword">d</span> =&gt; {
    console.<span class="hljs-literal">log</span>(toMarkdown(<span class="hljs-keyword">d</span>.<span class="hljs-keyword">toString</span>()))
  })
<span class="hljs-comment">// ...</span></code></pre><p>If you run the script again, you should see beautiful, super-readable Markdown!
All done!</p>
<hr>
<p>Well, mostly. This is nice and all, but there are definitely some things we can
do to make this script a bit better. Firstly, it&#39;s annoying to have to always
type <code>http://</code> before a URL, so maybe we should automatically add that on.</p>
<pre class="hljs"><code><span class="hljs-keyword">const</span> url = process.argv[<span class="hljs-number">2</span>]
<span class="hljs-keyword">const</span> src = url.includes(<span class="hljs-string">&#39;http://&#39;</span> || <span class="hljs-string">&#39;https://&#39;</span>) ? url : `http:<span class="hljs-comment">//${url}`</span></code></pre><p>All this extra bit is doing is checking if the passed in argument aleady has a
scheme, and if it doesn&#39;t, just sticking on on the beginning. If you&#39;re not
familiar with template literals, check out the previous tutorials and the <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Template_literals">docs
on
MDN</a>.</p>
<p>If you&#39;re not familiar with <code>Array.prototype.includes()</code>, it&#39;s basically a
shorthand for <code>.indexOf(foo !== -1)</code>.</p>
<p>Make sure you change the <code>get</code> call to use <code>src</code> instead of <code>url</code>.</p>
<p>And, as in the previous tutorials, we&#39;ll want to just be able to execute this
script, without needing to type in <code>node</code> each time, so add a shebang and make
it exectuable.</p>
<pre class="hljs"><code><span class="hljs-keyword">chmod</span> +<span class="hljs-keyword">x</span> <span class="hljs-keyword">index</span>.js</code></pre><pre class="hljs"><code>#!<span class="hljs-regexp">/usr/</span>bin/env node

<span class="hljs-keyword">const</span> { <span class="hljs-keyword">get</span> } = <span class="hljs-built_in">require</span>(<span class="hljs-string">&#39;http&#39;</span>)
<span class="hljs-comment">// ...</span></code></pre><p>Now you should be able to just do something like <code>./index.js zacanger.com</code> and
see some results.</p>
<p><code>to-markdown</code> can handle take some options. One of them is to use
<a href="https://help.github.com/categories/writing-on-github">GitHub-Flavored
Markdown</a>, which is
pretty nice since that&#39;s probably what most of us are used to using. To enable
this, just pass <code>{ gfm: true }</code> in the call to <code>toMarkdown</code>:</p>
<pre class="hljs"><code><span class="hljs-comment">// ...</span>
<span class="hljs-tag">console</span><span class="hljs-class">.log</span>(<span class="hljs-function">toMarkdown</span>(d.<span class="hljs-function">toString</span>(), { <span class="hljs-attribute">gfm</span>: true }))
<span class="hljs-comment">// ...</span></code></pre><p>You may notice some tags are making it through the conversion (<code>script</code>, <code>span</code>,
<code>div</code>, and probably a few others); I&#39;m not going to go over all of the options
that <code>to-markdown</code> can take, but you should check out the docs and learn how to
write filters, if you&#39;re interested. You could also write your own function to
strip out unwanted elements, and run the Markdown through this:</p>
<pre class="hljs"><code>const cleanOutStuff = <span class="hljs-keyword">string</span> =&gt;
  <span class="hljs-keyword">string</span>.<span class="hljs-built_in">replace</span>(/(<span class="hljs-operator">div</span>|script|span)/g, <span class="hljs-string">&#39;&#39;</span>)

console.<span class="hljs-built_in">log</span>(cleanOutStuff(toMarkdown(d.toString(), { gfm: <span class="hljs-constant">true</span> })))</code></pre><p>But it&#39;d probably be easier to just learn the options rather that spinning
something custom like this.</p>
<p>One thing that really irks me when I&#39;m reading in the terminal is text that
doesn&#39;t wrap. Sometimes I&#39;m on a very large screen, and it can get difficult to
keep track of where I am when the text is too wide. 80 characters is a pretty
reasonable limit, so why don&#39;t we get this text to wrap there? We&#39;re going to
use another module for this:
<a href="https://github.com/substack/node-wordwrap">wordwrap</a>.</p>
<pre class="hljs"><code>npm <span class="hljs-tag">i</span> -S wordwrap</code></pre><pre class="hljs"><code>const wordwrap = <span class="hljs-function"><span class="hljs-title">require</span><span class="hljs-params">(<span class="hljs-string">&#39;wordwrap&#39;</span>)</span></span></code></pre><p>This module needs to know how many characters it can put in a line. We could
just pass it <code>80</code>, but I think maybe we should handle cases where the terminal
is resized very small but maybe won&#39;t stay that way, so we&#39;re going to find out
how big the terminal currently is and base our decision on that.
<code>process.stdout</code> has a way for us to find this out.</p>
<pre class="hljs"><code><span class="hljs-keyword">const</span> wordwrap = require(<span class="hljs-string">&#39;wordwrap&#39;</span>)
<span class="hljs-keyword">const</span> { rows } = process.stdout
<span class="hljs-keyword">const</span> wraplength = (rows &lt; <span class="hljs-number">80</span> ? <span class="hljs-number">80</span> : rows)
<span class="hljs-keyword">const</span> wrapper = wordwrap(wraplength)</code></pre><p>All we&#39;re doing here is wrapping to either the width of the terminal or 80
characters, whichever happens to be greater.</p>
<p>Now we can use that <code>wrapper</code> when we log out the results.</p>
<pre class="hljs"><code><span class="hljs-tag">console</span><span class="hljs-class">.log</span>(<span class="hljs-tag">wrapper</span>(<span class="hljs-tag">toMarkdown</span>(<span class="hljs-tag">d</span><span class="hljs-class">.toString</span>(), <span class="hljs-rules">{ <span class="hljs-rule"><span class="hljs-attribute">gfm</span>:<span class="hljs-value"> true </span></span></span>})))</code></pre><hr>
<p>So, awesome! Your script should now do just about everything you want it to do.
There&#39;s really only one big thing left to do: make it less ugly. That
<code>console.log</code> is really getting gross, don&#39;t you think? I like to handle this by
just defining a bunch of functions I can throw together, so I don&#39;t have to have
all this junk cluttering up my space.</p>
<pre class="hljs"><code>const opts = { gfm: <span class="hljs-constant">true</span> }
const <span class="hljs-built_in">convert</span> = <span class="hljs-operator">a</span> =&gt; toMarkdown(<span class="hljs-operator">a</span>, opts)
const <span class="hljs-operator">wrap</span> = <span class="hljs-operator">a</span> =&gt; wrapper(<span class="hljs-operator">a</span>)
const <span class="hljs-built_in">log</span> = <span class="hljs-operator">a</span> =&gt; console.<span class="hljs-built_in">log</span>(<span class="hljs-operator">a</span>)</code></pre><p>I&#39;m using <code>a</code> as a parameter here. You can use something more descriptive if
you&#39;d like, it really doesn&#39;t matter.</p>
<p>And I think we should also just wait until we have all the data before logging
anything, so let&#39;s adjust our HTTP call (and stick it in a function):</p>
<pre class="hljs"><code>const main = arg =&gt; get<span class="hljs-list">(<span class="hljs-keyword">arg</span>, res =&gt; {
  let b = &#39;&#39; // <code>b</code> for <code>body</code>
  res.on<span class="hljs-list">(<span class="hljs-quoted">&#39;data</span>&#39;, d =&gt; b += d.toString)</span>
  res.on<span class="hljs-list">(<span class="hljs-quoted">&#39;end</span>&#39;, <span class="hljs-list">()</span> =&gt; log<span class="hljs-list">(<span class="hljs-keyword">wrap</span><span class="hljs-list">(<span class="hljs-keyword">convert</span><span class="hljs-list">(<span class="hljs-keyword">b</span>)</span>)</span>)</span>)</span>
})</span></code></pre><p>Your linter might yell at you saying you can&#39;t return assignment. It&#39;s probably
right, but nothing&#39;s going to break. If you&#39;re concerned about it, just wrap
that <code>b += d.toString()</code> in some braces.</p>
<p>Obviously, this is a function, so we need to call it somewhere.</p>

<p>Now you&#39;re really done! I suggest you go check out <code>to-markdown</code>, play around
with <code>process</code>, and see what else you can do with this thing. If you make
something pretty neat, you should consider releasing it! Check out <code>npm help
adduser</code> and <code>npm help publish</code> to see how you could go about this. (There are
probably similar modules out there, though, so make sure you&#39;re not stepping on
anyone&#39;s toes first!)</p>
<p>I&#39;d also suggest you do some basic error handling, but that&#39;s totally up to you.</p>
<p>For the previous two tutorials I waited until the following post to show a
finished version of the script; since this is the last tutorial on writing CLI
apps in Node that I intend to write, the full script is below, as well as my
manifest file (<code>package.json</code>).</p>
<p>Note: I tend to prefer shorter (but hopefully still readable) names for things,
and a somewhat opinionated code style, so the full script below may differ
a bit from your results, and that&#39;s totally fine.</p>

<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
<p>I really love writing little command-line utilities in Node. There are other
languages that may be better for this (Bash, Ruby, Perl), but Node is just more
<em>fun</em> than those (at least to me). I especially love trying to do simple little
tools with no dependencies, or wrapping up awesome modules to be used in your
terminal. The majority of <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/~zacanger">my published modules</a>
are little tools like this. A lot of folks only think of Node as the thing that
runs Express, or the thing that lets them test their code without a browser, or
whatever, though. So, this will be a short tutorial on writing a command-line
app in Node. At the end of it, you&#39;ll have a totally awesome little app for
taking notes in JSON. The full version of this app (with a few adjustments and
additions) is <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/lilnote">here</a>, and you can
install it to use in your terminal with <code>npm i -g lilnote</code>.</p>
<p>Okay, so, let&#39;s do stuff!</p>
<h2 id="update-node">Update Node</h2>
<p>First things first&mdash;make sure Node and npm are up to date. If you&#39;re
already using at least versions 6 of node and 3 of npm (<code>node -v</code> and <code>npm -v</code>
to find out), you&#39;re fine. Otherwise, you really should update.</p>
<p>I recommend using <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/n">n</a> for this. If you already
use NVM, go with that; if you&#39;re on Windows, you&#39;ll likely have to go download
the new version and manually install it. Otherwise, just <code>npm i -g n &amp;&amp; n latest
&amp;&amp; npm i -g npm@next</code> (you can leave out the last bit, but it&#39;s nice to have the
newest version of the coolest tools).</p>
<h2 id="start-a-project">Start a Project</h2>
<p>Make a new directory and start a project (<code>mkdir note-taking-app</code>, <code>cd
note-taking-app</code>, <code>npm init</code>, <code>touch index.js</code>, and <code>chmod +x index.js</code> to make
it executable).</p>
<p>You won&#39;t need any dependencies here; the <code>npm init</code> isn&#39;t vital, but if you
later wanted to add dependencies, publish this (please don&#39;t unless it&#39;s
significantly different from <a href="https://npmjs.com/package/lilnote">lilnote</a>!), or
something, it&#39;d be nice to just have this already set up.</p>
<p>If you want, you can add some fields to your <code>package.json</code> to specifiy that
it&#39;s a global, command-line sort of app. Add <code>&quot;preferGlobal&quot;: true</code> and <code>&quot;bin&quot;:
&quot;./index.js&quot;</code> for this.</p>
<h2 id="write-some-code">Write Some Code</h2>
<p>Open the <code>index.js</code> in your editor.</p>
<p>The first thing you&#39;ll need to write is the shebang. This is to let your shell
know how to execute this file. For a Node script, it should read <code>#!/usr/bin/env
node</code>. Any time you&#39;re writing an executable script, this goes on the first
line. You&#39;ll use a similar thing for any language you&#39;d use (for example,
<code>#!/bin/bash</code> for a Bash script, or <code>#!/usr/bin/ruby</code> for a Ruby script&mdash;
the <code>env</code> bit says &#39;find out what my computer thinks Node is, and execute that
script with that thing&#39;&mdash;it&#39;s the same idea as doing <code>which node index.js</code>).</p>
<p>We&#39;re going to require some stuff. If you happen to be using <code>babel-node</code> or
using <code>babel-register</code> you could use <code>import</code>s here, but we&#39;ll go with
<code>require</code>s because this means we can keep our app dependency-free.</p>
<p>Add <code>&#39;use strict&#39;</code> to the next line. You don&#39;t <em>have</em> to do this, <a href="https://www.nczonline.net/blog/2012/03/13/its-time-to-start-using-javascript-strict-mode">but you
should</a>.</p>
<p>We&#39;ll require just one thing to start with: <code>fs</code>, which is built in to Node.</p>
<p>Our file should currently look like this:</p>
<pre class="hljs"><code><span class="hljs-comment">#!/usr/bin/env node</span>

<span class="hljs-string">&#39;use strict&#39;</span>

<span class="hljs-keyword">const</span> fs = <span class="hljs-built_in">require</span>(<span class="hljs-string">&#39;fs&#39;</span>)</code></pre><p>Our app is going to read input from the terminal, so we&#39;ll need to use the
built-in <code>process</code>. This provides an <code>argv</code>, which is an &#39;argument
vector&#39;&mdash;an array of all things entered on the command-line, which will
always start with <code>node</code> and the file that&#39;s being run. So, we&#39;ll use
<code>process.argv[2]</code>, which will be the first manually entered argument. Sidenote:
<code>process</code> is an awesome piece of Node, and if you&#39;re not familiar with it, open
a REPL (just enter <code>node</code> in the terminal) and type in <code>process</code>, and skim
through that gigantic object.</p>
<pre class="hljs"><code><span class="hljs-keyword">const</span> arg = process.argv[<span class="hljs-number">2</span>]</code></pre><p>Parsing arguments is tedious and sometimes difficult. There are a
<a href="https://github.com/tj/commander.js">lot</a> of
<a href="https://github.com/substack/minimist">awesome</a>
<a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/yargs">modules</a> that exist for this, and if you
keep building cli apps in Node you should definitely investigate these, but for
this tutorial we&#39;ll parse options manually. In the same way that you should know
how HTTP works and then maybe use <a href="http://koajs.com">Koa</a> or
<a href="http://hapijs.com">hapi</a>, you should know how arguments work before deciding on
a library to handle them.</p>
<p>We&#39;ll need a couple of other things before we can really get going. We should
probably do something with that <code>fs</code> module&mdash;let&#39;s use it to specify a
piece of JSON we&#39;ll work against. I won&#39;t get into how to handle what happens if
that file doesn&#39;t already exist here, but you can check out <a href="https://github.com/zacanger/lilnote/blob/master/check-file.js#L10">lilnote&#39;s source
code</a> if
you&#39;re curious. For our purposes, you should <code>touch notes.json</code> in the same
directory as your app, and put an empty array (<code>[]</code>) in there. (Note: <code>lilnote</code>
uses a file under the user&#39;s home directory; that&#39;s another thing we won&#39;t worry
about right now, but it&#39;s <a href="https://github.com/zacanger/lilnote/blob/master/check-file.js#L10">pretty
easy</a> to do.)</p>
<p>Let&#39;s add another couple of declarations:</p>
<pre class="hljs"><code><span class="hljs-keyword">const</span> <span class="hljs-keyword">n</span> = &#39;./<span class="hljs-keyword">notes</span>.json&#39;
<span class="hljs-keyword">const</span> <span class="hljs-keyword">file</span> = fs.readFileSync(<span class="hljs-keyword">n</span>)</code></pre><p>We&#39;re using <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/Destructuring_assignment">destructuring
assignment</a>
in that <code>resolve</code> line&mdash;it&#39;s the same as saying <code>var path = require(&#39;path&#39;)
; var file = path.resolve(&#39;./notes.json&#39;)</code>.</p>
<p>We&#39;ll also have a variable here for our read-in notes.</p>
<pre class="hljs"><code><span class="hljs-keyword">const</span> <span class="hljs-keyword">notes</span> = JSON.<span class="hljs-keyword">parse</span>(<span class="hljs-keyword">file</span>)</code></pre><p>And since we&#39;ll be using <code>console.log</code> in a few places, let&#39;s just make that a
little shorter:</p>
<pre class="hljs"><code><span class="hljs-keyword">const</span> <span class="hljs-built_in">log</span> = console.<span class="hljs-built_in">log</span></code></pre><p>Your file should now look something like this:</p>
<pre class="hljs"><code>#!/usr/bin/env node

&#39;<span class="hljs-keyword">use</span> strict&#39;

<span class="hljs-keyword">const</span> fs = require(&#39;fs&#39;)
<span class="hljs-keyword">const</span> <span class="hljs-keyword">log</span> = console.<span class="hljs-literal">log</span>
<span class="hljs-keyword">const</span> arg = process.argv[2]
<span class="hljs-keyword">const</span> <span class="hljs-keyword">n</span> = &#39;./<span class="hljs-keyword">notes</span>.json&#39;
<span class="hljs-keyword">const</span> <span class="hljs-keyword">file</span> = fs.readFileSync(<span class="hljs-keyword">n</span>)
<span class="hljs-keyword">const</span> <span class="hljs-keyword">notes</span> = JSON.<span class="hljs-keyword">parse</span>(<span class="hljs-keyword">file</span>)</code></pre><p>And your file structure should look something like:</p>
<pre class="hljs"><code>project-root
  package<span class="hljs-class">.json</span>
  index<span class="hljs-class">.js</span>
  notes.json</code></pre><h2 id="make-it-do-things">Make It Do Things</h2>
<p>So let&#39;s do stuff! First let&#39;s make a way to record notes taken. This will work
by just calling your script and treating the first argument as a note.</p>
<pre class="hljs"><code>./index<span class="hljs-class">.js</span> <span class="hljs-string">&quot;go to the grocery store&quot;</span>
./index<span class="hljs-class">.js</span> cook
./index<span class="hljs-class">.js</span> eat
./index<span class="hljs-class">.js</span> <span class="hljs-string">&quot;wash dishes&quot;</span></code></pre><p>Let&#39;s write a function for this.</p>
<pre class="hljs"><code><span class="hljs-keyword">const</span> takeNote = (<span class="hljs-keyword">notes</span>, <span class="hljs-keyword">note</span>) =&gt; {
  <span class="hljs-keyword">notes</span>.push(<span class="hljs-keyword">note</span>)
  <span class="hljs-keyword">const</span> taken = JSON.stringify(<span class="hljs-keyword">notes</span>, null, 2)
  fs.writeFile(<span class="hljs-keyword">n</span>, taken, &#39;utf8&#39;, <span class="hljs-keyword">err</span> =&gt; {
    <span class="hljs-keyword">if</span> (<span class="hljs-keyword">err</span>) <span class="hljs-keyword">return</span> <span class="hljs-literal">log</span>(<span class="hljs-keyword">err</span>)
  })
}</code></pre><p>Note that we&#39;re using function expressions, not function declarations. This
could also be written as:</p>
<pre class="hljs"><code>function takeNote (<span class="hljs-keyword">notes</span>, <span class="hljs-keyword">note</span>) {
  <span class="hljs-keyword">notes</span>.push(<span class="hljs-keyword">note</span>)
  <span class="hljs-keyword">var</span> taken = JSON.stringify(<span class="hljs-keyword">notes</span>, null, 2)
  fs.writeFile(<span class="hljs-keyword">file</span>, taken, &#39;utf8&#39;, function(<span class="hljs-keyword">err</span>) {
    <span class="hljs-keyword">if</span> (<span class="hljs-keyword">err</span>) {
      <span class="hljs-keyword">return</span> <span class="hljs-literal">log</span>(<span class="hljs-keyword">err</span>)
    }
  })
}</code></pre><p>These extra parameters to <code>JSON.stringify()</code> make our JSON look decent. Check
out the <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/JSON/stringify">docs on
MDN</a>
if you&#39;re not familiar with them.</p>
<p>We&#39;re taking in the array of notes and a note, and pushing that note to the
array of notes. Then we&#39;re using <code>writeFile()</code> from <code>fs</code> to write to the <code>file</code>
we declared earlier, using the <code>taken</code> we declared earlier, with the encoding
<code>UTF-8</code>. The callback here is in case there&#39;s an error&mdash;if the file doesn&#39;t
already exist, for example.</p>
<p>We should handle this function where we process our command-line arguments,
which we&#39;ll get to in a little bit.</p>
<p>Let&#39;s also write a function for removing a note by its index in the array.</p>
<pre class="hljs"><code><span class="hljs-keyword">const</span> removeNote = (<span class="hljs-keyword">notes</span>, noteIndex) =&gt; {

}</code></pre><p>Awesome! That&#39;s like 90% of our app right there.</p>
<p>We should probably handle some arguments so we can actually use this thing.</p>
<h2 id="make-it-all-work">Make It All Work</h2>
<p>We&#39;re going to do this with a series of <code>if</code> statements. We could also use a
<code>switch</code> here, but for a lot of people that&#39;ll seem a little unfamiliar. Let&#39;s
assume that you&#39;ll use <code>-s</code> to show all notes, and <code>-r</code> to remove a note. We
should also handle a case where there are no arguments passed.</p>
<pre class="hljs"><code><span class="hljs-keyword">if</span> (!arg) {
  <span class="hljs-keyword">return</span> <span class="hljs-literal">log</span>(&#39;Please pass <span class="hljs-keyword">an</span> argument&#39;)
}
<span class="hljs-keyword">if</span> (arg &amp;&amp; arg === &#39;-r&#39;) {
  <span class="hljs-keyword">const</span> noteIndex = process.argv[3]
  <span class="hljs-keyword">return</span> removeNote(<span class="hljs-keyword">notes</span>, noteIndex)
}
<span class="hljs-keyword">if</span> (arg &amp;&amp; arg === &#39;-s&#39;) {
  <span class="hljs-keyword">return</span> <span class="hljs-literal">log</span>(<span class="hljs-keyword">notes</span>)
}
<span class="hljs-keyword">else</span> {
  <span class="hljs-keyword">return</span> takeNote(<span class="hljs-keyword">notes</span>, arg)
}</code></pre><p>So, that&#39;s a basic way to handle command-line options. Let&#39;s just wrap that last
bit in a function and call it at the end. It&#39;s not beautiful, but if you put a
little bit of work into this, you could have a decent app! Here&#39;s how your whole
file should look, now:</p>
<pre class="hljs"><code>#!/usr/bin/env node

run in your terminal. I&#39;ve got a more in-depth tutorial coming up soon,
but wanted to get this idea out there tonight.</p>
<p><a href="http://ryanwalsh.io">Someone</a> brought up the idea of a React component
generator the other day, and I immediately thought <em>Bash script</em>. Well, that&#39;s
pretty easy.</p>
<pre class="hljs"><code><span class="hljs-shebang">#!/bin/bash
</span>
<span class="hljs-built_in">echo</span> <span class="hljs-string">&quot;
import React from &#39;react&#39;

const <span class="hljs-variable">$1</span> = () =&gt; (
  &lt;div&gt;<span class="hljs-variable">$1</span>&lt;/div&gt;
)

export default <span class="hljs-variable">$1</span>
&quot;</span> &gt; <span class="hljs-variable">$1</span>.js</code></pre><p>There you go, a basic pure component generator script. This could be a little
more complex, handle some content, handle generating a class instead of a
function, and whatever, but that&#39;s the basic idea, in Bash.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Keep in mind, none of this is React-specific. All we&#39;re doing is handling
arguments and spitting out a file.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The idea here is that you just call this script from somewhere and it gives you
a component already laid out for you. It&#39;s not too fancy, but it&#39;s useful.</p>
<pre class="hljs"><code>$ ./my-script.sh Foo

$ cat Foo.js

<span class="hljs-literal">import</span> React from <span class="hljs-string">&#39;react&#39;</span>

<span class="hljs-keyword">const</span> Foo = () =&gt; (
  &lt;div&gt;Foo&lt;/div&gt;
)

<span class="hljs-literal">export</span> <span class="hljs-keyword">default</span> Foo</code></pre><p>That could save a little bit of time. I use something similar for generating an
<code>index.html</code> for React apps.</p>
<p>This is a lot like using snippets in your editor, except it doesn&#39;t rely on you
having that editor and those snippets handy. You could pass this around to anyone
who uses any editor, on any computer, and get the same result. You could upload
it to somewhere and just <code>curl my-script.sh | bash</code> and not even need to have the
file around. Pretty handy, I think.</p>
<p>But... what about in JS? I mean, we&#39;re JavaScript devs, right?</p>
<p>It&#39;s still pretty straightforward in Node, as it happens.</p>
<p>We only need one file to get going. I&#39;ll call mine <del>compgen</del> rcg.js, for React
Component Generator.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I apologize in advance, some of the syntax highlighting will look a little
odd... apparently the highlighting library I use doesn&#39;t understand template
strings.</p>
</blockquote>
<pre class="hljs"><code>touch rcg.js     # <span class="hljs-operator"><span class="hljs-keyword">create</span> a <span class="hljs-keyword">new</span> <span class="hljs-keyword">file</span>
chmod +x rcg.js  # <span class="hljs-keyword">set</span> an executable <span class="hljs-built_in">bit</span> <span class="hljs-keyword">on</span> the <span class="hljs-keyword">file</span>
vi rcg.js        # <span class="hljs-keyword">open</span> it <span class="hljs-keyword">for</span> editing</span></code></pre><p>(Obviously substitute your editor for <code>vi</code>.)</p>
<p>What&#39;s the first thing any executable script needs? A shebang! We&#39;ll also go
ahead and use <code>process</code>. If you don&#39;t know <code>process</code>, open Node in a terminal
(<code>node</code>) and just type in <code>process</code>. It&#39;s pretty cool. The bit we want is
<code>.argv</code>, which is an array of all arguments passed. It always has <code>node</code> and the
file that&#39;s calling it as the first two elements, so we don&#39;t need those.</p>
<pre class="hljs"><code><span class="hljs-shebang">#!/usr/bin/env node</span>

<span class="hljs-keyword">const</span> args = process.argv.slice(<span class="hljs-number">2</span>)
<span class="hljs-keyword">const</span> type = args[<span class="hljs-number">0</span>]
<span class="hljs-keyword">const</span> component = args[<span class="hljs-number">1</span>]</code></pre><p>What we&#39;re going for here is a script we can call like <code>./rcg.js function Foo</code>,
or with a <code>class</code> parameter instead.</p>
<p>The next thing we&#39;ll need to do is actually sketch out these components. I&#39;ll be
using template literals. If you don&#39;t have a recent version of Node, you should
update. If you can&#39;t update, you&#39;ll have to use string concatenation instead (so
really, you should just update). To update (on Mac or Linux; on Windows you
should just go to <a href="http://nodejs.org">the website</a> and download a new version),
just <code>npm i -g n &amp;&amp; n latest</code>.</p>
<p>Let&#39;s write out what a pure (function) component looks like, first.</p>
<pre class="hljs"><code><span class="hljs-keyword">const</span> pureComponent = <span class="hljs-string">`</span>
<span class="hljs-keyword">import</span> React <span class="hljs-keyword">from</span> <span class="hljs-string">&#39;react&#39;</span>

<span class="hljs-keyword">const</span> ${component} = () =&gt; &lt;div&gt;${component}&lt;/div&gt;

<span class="hljs-keyword">export</span> <span class="hljs-keyword">default</span> ${component}
<span class="hljs-string">`</span></code></pre><p>It doesn&#39;t have a whole lot going on, I know. This is just a quick file
generator, it can&#39;t write your code for you. :P</p>
<p>If you can&#39;t update node, that&#39;d look something like this:</p>
<pre class="hljs"><code><span class="hljs-keyword">var</span> pureComponent = <span class="hljs-string">&#39;import React from \&#39;</span>react\<span class="hljs-string">&#39;&#39;</span> +
<span class="hljs-string">&#39;function &#39;</span> + component + <span class="hljs-string">&#39;(){&#39;</span> +
  <span class="hljs-string">&#39;return &lt;div&gt;&#39;</span> + component + <span class="hljs-string">&#39;&lt;/div&gt;&#39;</span> +
<span class="hljs-string">&#39;}&#39;</span> +
<span class="hljs-string">&#39;module.exports = &#39;</span> + component</code></pre><p>(Kind of annoying, right?)</p>
<p>So now, let&#39;s get one for a class (I won&#39;t go through doing this one with an old
version of Node, nor with <code>React.createClass</code>&mdash;just with ES2015 classes).</p>
<pre class="hljs"><code><span class="hljs-keyword">const</span> classComponent = <span class="hljs-string">`</span>
<span class="hljs-keyword">import</span> React, { Component } <span class="hljs-keyword">from</span> <span class="hljs-string">&#39;react&#39;</span>

<span class="hljs-keyword">export</span> <span class="hljs-keyword">default</span> <span class="hljs-class"><span class="hljs-keyword">class</span> <span class="hljs-title">$</span>{<span class="hljs-title">component</span>} <span class="hljs-keyword">extends</span> <span class="hljs-title">Component</span> {</span>
  render() {
    <span class="hljs-keyword">return</span> (
      &lt;div&gt;${component}&lt;/div&gt;
    )
  }
}
<span class="hljs-string">`</span></code></pre><p>Lovely! Obviously this should be more complex; if your class only has a render
function that returns JSX, just use a function instead.</p>
<p>Great, now you have a bunch of stuff in a file that doesn&#39;t do anything! Let&#39;s
handle arguments and make it actually do things.</p>
<p>There are a lot of great libraries for parsing options, and I&#39;ll list a few of
them in the next blog post. For now, we&#39;ll just use <code>if</code> statements.</p>
<pre class="hljs"><code><span class="hljs-keyword">let</span> toWrite <span class="hljs-comment">// this is what we&#39;ll end up writing to a file</span>
<span class="hljs-keyword">if</span> (<span class="hljs-class"><span class="hljs-keyword">type</span> </span>=== &#39;<span class="hljs-keyword">function</span>&#39;) {
  toWrite = pureComponent
}
<span class="hljs-keyword">if</span> (<span class="hljs-class"><span class="hljs-keyword">type</span> </span>=== &#39;<span class="hljs-keyword">class</span>&#39;) {
  toWrite = classComponent
}
<span class="hljs-keyword">if</span> (<span class="hljs-class"><span class="hljs-keyword">type</span> !</span>== &#39;<span class="hljs-keyword">function</span>&#39; &amp;&amp; <span class="hljs-class"><span class="hljs-keyword">type</span> !</span>== &#39;<span class="hljs-keyword">class</span>&#39;) {
  console.log(&#39;please pass <span class="hljs-class"><span class="hljs-keyword">type</span> <span class="hljs-title">of</span> <span class="hljs-title">component</span> <span class="hljs-title">as</span> <span class="hljs-title">first</span> <span class="hljs-title">argument</span>&#39;)</span>
}</code></pre><p>That&#39;s a little sloppy&mdash;intentionally! I&#39;m hoping you take some time to
write this out a little better than just copying and pasting from this blog
post.</p>
<p>There&#39;s one major bit left: actually writing a file. We&#39;ll need Node&#39;s <code>fs</code> for
this.</p>
<pre class="hljs"><code><span class="hljs-keyword">const</span> { writeFile } = <span class="hljs-built_in">require</span>(<span class="hljs-string">&#39;fs&#39;</span>)</code></pre><p>Now, at the bottom of our file, let&#39;s actually do the fun bit.</p>
<pre class="hljs"><code>writeFile<span class="hljs-list">(`${component}.js`, toWrite, <span class="hljs-quoted">&#39;utf8</span>&#39;, err =&gt; {
  if <span class="hljs-list">(<span class="hljs-keyword">err</span>)</span> console.log<span class="hljs-list">(<span class="hljs-keyword">err</span>)</span>
})</span></code></pre><p>Now your whole file should look something like this:</p>
<pre class="hljs"><code><span class="hljs-comment">#!/usr/bin/env node</span>

<span class="hljs-keyword">const</span> args = process.argv.slice(<span class="hljs-number">2</span>)
<span class="hljs-keyword">const</span> type = args[<span class="hljs-number">0</span>]
<span class="hljs-keyword">const</span> component = args[<span class="hljs-number">1</span>]
<span class="hljs-keyword">const</span> { writeFile } = <span class="hljs-built_in">require</span>(<span class="hljs-string">&#39;fs&#39;</span>)

<span class="hljs-keyword">const</span> pureComponent = <span class="hljs-string">`</span>
<span class="hljs-keyword">import</span> React <span class="hljs-keyword">from</span> <span class="hljs-string">&#39;react&#39;</span>

<span class="hljs-keyword">const</span> ${component} = () =&gt; &lt;div&gt;${component}&lt;/div&gt;

<span class="hljs-keyword">export</span> <span class="hljs-keyword">default</span> ${component}
<span class="hljs-string">`</span>

<span class="hljs-keyword">const</span> classComponent = <span class="hljs-string">`</span>
<span class="hljs-keyword">import</span> React, { Component } <span class="hljs-keyword">from</span> <span class="hljs-string">&#39;react&#39;</span>

<span class="hljs-keyword">export</span> <span class="hljs-keyword">default</span> <span class="hljs-class"><span class="hljs-keyword">class</span> <span class="hljs-title">$</span>{<span class="hljs-title">component</span>} <span class="hljs-keyword">extends</span> <span class="hljs-title">Component</span> {</span>
  render() {
    <span class="hljs-keyword">return</span> (
      &lt;div&gt;${component}&lt;/div&gt;
    )
  }
}
<span class="hljs-string">`</span>

<span class="hljs-keyword">let</span> toWrite
<span class="hljs-keyword">if</span> (type === <span class="hljs-string">&#39;function&#39;</span>) {
  toWrite = pureComponent
}
<span class="hljs-keyword">if</span> (type === <span class="hljs-string">&#39;class&#39;</span>) {
  toWrite = classComponent
}
<span class="hljs-keyword">if</span> (type !== <span class="hljs-string">&#39;function&#39;</span> &amp;&amp; type !== <span class="hljs-string">&#39;class&#39;</span>) {
  <span class="hljs-built_in">console</span>.log(<span class="hljs-string">&#39;please pass type of component as first argument&#39;</span>)
}

writeFile(<span class="hljs-string">`${component}.js`,</span> toWrite, <span class="hljs-string">&#39;utf8&#39;</span>, err =&gt; {
  <span class="hljs-keyword">if</span> (err) <span class="hljs-built_in">console</span>.log(err)
})</code></pre><p>Boom! You&#39;ve made a command-line app! You can drop this anywhere in your <code>$PATH</code>
and call it from anywhere to generate a component for you! (<code>$PATH</code> is where
your system looks for files to execute. If you don&#39;t have something like a
<code>~/bin</code> directory, maybe <code>mv rcg.js /usr/local/bin</code>. If you don&#39;t want to move it
somewhere like that, you can always either do <code>./rcg.js</code> or <code>node rcg</code>.)</p>
<p>That&#39;s it! This script is not super clean. There are a few little things that
can be done to make it a lot better, like using a <code>switch</code> statement to handle
arguments, handling unexpected arguments, not overwritting an existing file,
passing more options, and trimming extra lines from the generated files, and not
keeping your templates in the same file as all the rest of the things. I&#39;m going
to leave that up to you. Have fun with it!</p>
<p>If you&#39;re interested in doing this kind of stuff in Node, be sure to check back!
I&#39;ve got two more tutorials on writing command-line apps in Node, which will go
progressively more in depth, on the way</p>

<p>Manager: &#39;It&#39;s in Angular.&#39;</p>
<p>Me: &#39;Urgh, right, okay, no prob.&#39;</p>
<p>Me: &#39;In [C# app]?&#39;</p>
<p>Manager: &#39;Yeah.&#39;</p>
<p>Me: Spends five hours fighting Visual Studio.</p>
<p>True story.</p>
<p>Some Visual Studio oddities:</p>
<ul>
<li>undo is ctrl-z, but</li>
<li>redo is shift-alt-backspace.</li>
<li>there&#39;s no &#39;revert&#39; (which even basic text editors have)</li>
<li>shift-tab only works if you have multiple lines selected</li>
<li>jump-to-matching-symbol (<code>%</code> in vim) only works sometimes</li>
<li>there&#39;s no search-in-open-buffers, i think</li>
<li>commenting out code: <code>ctrl-k ctrl-c</code></li>
<li>selecting text and hitting quotes will delete the text, not wrap in quotes</li>
<li>line-numbers are off by default</li>
<li>menus upon menus upon menus, each one slower than the last</li>
</ul>
<p>I&#39;m sure it&#39;s a really great IDE for C# people, but goddamn, it&#39;s slow.</p>
<p>It also has that horrible malware problem where you need to have Windows to use it.</p>

And kind of stream-of-consciousness.</p>
<p>Have a changelog. This doesn&#39;t have to be something complicated. It can actually
be <em>really</em> simple. Here&#39;s a script that&#39;ll do this for you.</p>

things work now.</p>
<p>Don&#39;t decrease code coverage. This goes back to &#39;if you write a thing, write a
test for it.&#39;</p>
<p>Don&#39;t bring in new libraries/frameworks/whatever unless without good reason.</p>
<p>Keep all dependencies up to date. If there&#39;s a breaking change, take a day to
update your code. If there are breaking changes all the time and no easy way to
update (like codemods), get rid of that dependency.</p>
<p>Delete code. As much as possible. Don&#39;t keep it around &#39;just in case&#39; or
something. Get rid of it.</p>
<p>Don&#39;t write very specific functions. And name your functions appropriately.  No
<code>getThisSpecificPieceOfData()</code>; instead, <code>getData(specificPiece)</code>. And then, if
you&#39;re going to be calling it with that specific piece of data, maybe write a
second function. But have that first one, first. <code>const getThisThing =
getThings(thisThing)</code>.</p>
<p>Don&#39;t stress about not knowing something. Either someone else knows it, or
literally no one around you knows it so you can be the first to figure it out,
which is cool. (I suck at this not-stressing bit, but I&#39;m trying.)</p>
<p>No language or framework or library sucks. I mean, okay, some do, but most
really don&#39;t, they&#39;re just probably not what you&#39;re looking for. Even Angular
doesn&#39;t <em>suck</em>, it&#39;s just not a good fit for many many webapps. And by the same
token, not all good things are always good. React is great, but if you&#39;re doing
a little static site, screw it, just use jQuery. It&#39;s okay. No one will judge
you too harshly. And if they do, screw them, too.</p>
<p>Some paradigms are better than others, but no one will ever agree on which ones
are better, so it&#39;s best to just pretend that OO is great when talking to C#
people, and that FP is great when talking to Haskell people, or whatever.
Believe whatever you want to believe, and if you do decide to stick hardcore to
one way of writing code, make sure you know it <em>really</em> well.</p>
<p>Use the simplest tool possible. This isn&#39;t my principle, this is a law. But
people break it all the time, <strong>especially</strong> in the front-end world. If you can
do it with ten lines of Bash, do it with ten lines of Bash, don&#39;t install five
dependencies to be able to do it in 40 lines of JS. (If you&#39;re on a computer
that doesn&#39;t have Bash, change or update your OS. Even Windows has Bash, now.)</p>
<p>Premature abstractions are just as bad as premature optimizations. Avoid, avoid,
avoid.</p>
<p>Being good at using a computer comes first. If you can&#39;t use the basic tools you
need to do your job, you need to learn that first. That means your hardware,
your OS, your terminal, your shell, your editor, your browser, whatever. You
don&#39;t need to go read the source and learn every hotkey and all that, but being
good with your tools means being faster and more productive, which gives you a
lot more time for thinking, reading docs, and all the other things that you
actually do most of the time when writing code.</p>
<p>Also, type. If you can&#39;t type well, practice. I&#39;m a fast typist&mdash;114 wpm,
which is pretty fast&mdash;and while it hasn&#39;t made me a <em>better</em> developer,
being able to type things quickly means I have more time to do all the things
that aren&#39;t just typing. Like thinking and reading docs.</p>
<p>Figure out what doesn&#39;t work, and what you don&#39;t like. That&#39;s actually pretty
easy to do. Just play with a lot of things and learn what sucks, to you.</p>
<p>No job is worth screwing up your personal life over. If you can&#39;t take a few
days off for important events without much warning, find a different job. You&#39;re
a developer. You&#39;re in control, in the current job market.</p>
<p>Don&#39;t just code. It&#39;s bad for you. Have something else. Music, woodworking,
fancy-wine-drinking, whatever. You need to get your eyes away from the screen
for a while, and get your wrists out of that position. You&#39;ll end up blind with
carpal tunnel if all you do is code all day long.</p>
<p>If a tool you&#39;re using isn&#39;t working out (that could be a language, framework,
package manager, OS, cloud provider, whatever), find a way to get rid of it.
That might take a while (ages, maybe), but it&#39;ll be worth it. Good tools are
worth using. Don&#39;t get yourself stuck with shitty ones. You can almost always
find a way to gradually switch over, so it&#39;s not a big immediate change for your
team or your project or whatever. If you use an editor you don&#39;t like, but
you&#39;re not sure you&#39;d like anything else better, just try a different editor.
Maybe try a different one every two weeks, &#39;til you&#39;ve picked one.</p>
<p>Laptop screens aren&#39;t great. Get a decent monitor for at home. Just do it. It&#39;s
worth it. Also a decent mouse, if you use a mouse. If you have a laptop with a
crappy keyboard, treat yourself to a nice keyboard. All these things make a
difference.</p>
<p>No language is great.  No one has ever written a language that&#39;s just perfect.
Anyone who claims their language is provably superior in all ways to your language
is either an idiot or trying to sell you something. No one will ever write a
language that&#39;s great for everything in all ways, either. So just find one that
works kind of okay in a way you feel like you can live with, and go with that.
Doesn&#39;t matter if that&#39;s Smalltalk, ML, Jelly, or Brainfuck. If you can be
productive in it and it works for the thing you&#39;re making (and for your team),
do that, and screw the haters.</p>
<p>Don&#39;t live on energy drinks, pizza, and IPAs on Friday nights.</p>
<p>I&#39;m a little off-topic now I guess, so, that&#39;s all.</p>
