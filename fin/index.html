<p>I may add things to this list, or remove ones that I&#39;ve straight-up decided were
a bad idea (like buying a car).</p>
<p>The checklist is using GFM, which this blog generator doesn&#39;t understand. (That&#39;s on the list.)</p>

      <p><p>I wrote this on <a href="https://mastodon.social/@zacanger">Mastodon</a> but decided
to cross-post for whatever reason.</p>
<p>One of my biggest pet peeves is when people talk about how great foo-lang is as
an alernative to bar-lang, &amp; it turns out they&#39;re just shit at bar-lang, or
write deliberately bad bar-lang in examples to try to make foo-lang look better.
Don&#39;t do that. If you can&#39;t write decent, idiomatic bar-lang, you don&#39;t get to
hate it yet. If you <em>can</em> and are writing it like someone who&#39;s never read a
tutorial on it intentionally, you&#39;re just making foo-lang&#39;s community look like
assholes.  Chances are foo-lang is pretty great, &amp; can stand up on its own
merits. Talk about those, not how bad your half-assed bar-lang is in comparison.
I see this a lot with functional languages that compile to JS, especially, &amp;
it&#39;s sad, because most of those languages are actually really neat &amp; there are a
lot of good reasons to try them, but people saying &#39;look how horrible this JS is
compared to this other thing&#39; when the JS looks like it was written by someone
who skimmed a jQuery tutorial once <em>really</em> doesn&#39;t present the community very
well. So don&#39;t do that.</p>
<p>Also: a fun vim/Twitter trick (I also cross-posted this to
<a href="https://twitter.com/zacanger">Twitter</a> ): <code>:set textwidth=140</code>, then <code>gq</code>.

    <section class="post-content">
      <p><h1 id="wtf-is-set-">WTF is Set?</h1>
<p>Please excuse the funky syntax highlighting in this post. Apparently
the thing my blog uses for that doesn&#39;t know what to do about template strings.</p>
<p>So, someone asked in a Slack channel how they might clean up the following code:</p>
<pre class="hljs"><code>getNames (contacts) {
  <span class="hljs-built_in">let</span> contacts_<span class="hljs-built_in">set</span> = []

  contacts.forEach((contact) =&gt; {
    <span class="hljs-built_in">let</span> firstName = get(contact, <span class="hljs-string">&#39;contactInfo.firstName&#39;</span>)
    <span class="hljs-built_in">let</span> lastName  = get(contact, <span class="hljs-string">&#39;contactInfo.lastName&#39;</span>)
    <span class="hljs-built_in">let</span> fullName = `<span class="hljs-variable">${firstName}</span> <span class="hljs-variable">${lastName}</span>`

    <span class="hljs-keyword">if</span> (contacts_set.includes(fullName)) {
      <span class="hljs-built_in">return</span>
    } <span class="hljs-keyword">else</span> {
      contacts_set.push(fullName)
    }

    <span class="hljs-built_in">set</span>(this, <span class="hljs-string">&#39;contactsSet&#39;</span>, contactsSet)
  })
}</code></pre><p>Note that the <code>get</code> and <code>set</code> going on here seemed to be Ember-specific. I don&#39;t
know Ember so don&#39;t ask me.</p>
<p>And I said, how about this?</p>
<pre class="hljs"><code><span class="hljs-attribute">getNames</span>: <span class="hljs-function"><span class="hljs-params">(contacts)</span> =&gt;</span>
  [...<span class="hljs-keyword">new</span> Set(
    contacts.map(<span class="hljs-function"><span class="hljs-params">({ contactInfo: { firstName, lastName }})</span> =&gt;</span>
      `<span class="javascript">${firstName} ${lastName}</span>`))]</code></pre><p>I like this version because it&#39;s very concise and still readable (to me).
It also doesn&#39;t do mutation-y stuff, which is a good thing.</p>
<p>And then someone else asked:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Can some one eli5 what <code>Set</code> is that&#39;s referenced above?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Which made me realise that a lot of folks still aren&#39;t using a lot of the nice
new things from ES2015, so I explained a bit. Here&#39;s how I understand it.</p>
<p>Set is a new (in ES2015) iterable builtin (like Array, String, TypedArray). Map
is also new in 2015. Set is to Array as Map is to Object, kinda.</p>
<p>For practical usage Set is basically Array but unique, and with different
methods. <code>add</code>, <code>has</code>, <code>delete</code>, <code>size</code>, and some others. There&#39;s a lot more
info <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Set">on MDN</a>.</p>
<p>You can pass <code>Set</code> an iterable, which is why the thing I have above works
(because thing inside <code>new Set()</code> results in an array).</p>
<p>In that case <code>Set</code> isn&#39;t being used for too much besides just the fact that it&#39;s
<code>Set</code> (so it only holds unique values). Someone else pointed out in the same
channel that maybe it&#39;s not the best idea if you have a lot of values, because
then you&#39;re creating another thing, which is totally true.</p>
<p>There&#39;s a bit more background
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Set_(mathematics">here</a>) on what JS&#39;s <code>Set</code> is
suppose to be kind of like.</p>
<p>And underneath it sorta looks vaguely like this:</p>
<pre class="hljs"><code><span class="hljs-keyword">class</span> Set {
  <span class="hljs-constructor"><span class="hljs-keyword">constructor</span> () </span>{
    <span class="hljs-keyword">this</span>.storage = []
  }
  add (a) {
    <span class="hljs-keyword">if</span> (!<span class="hljs-keyword">this</span>.storage.includes(a)) {
      <span class="hljs-keyword">this</span>.storage.push(a)
    }
  }
  has (a) {
    <span class="hljs-keyword">return</span> <span class="hljs-keyword">this</span>.storage.includes(a)
  }
  remove (a) {
    <span class="hljs-keyword">this</span>.storage.splice(<span class="hljs-keyword">this</span>.storage.indexOf(a), <span class="hljs-number">1</span>)
  }
}</code></pre><p>That&#39;s a lot of stuff, but mostly you can think of <code>Set</code> as a thing that&#39;s like
<code>Array</code> but it only holds unique things.</p>
<p>There&#39;s also a <code>WeakSet</code> which can only hold objects. I haven&#39;t really found a
valid use case for <code>WeakSet</code> and <code>WeakMap</code> yet, personally.</p>
<p><code>Set</code> turns out to be pretty useful. I&#39;ve used it a few times <a href="https://jane.com">at
work</a> (with appropriate polyfills) without any problems, and I
use it in a few places in <a href="https://github.com/zacanger/zeelib">zeelib</a>, my
sort-of-sometimes-popular utility library. Definitely play around with it!</p>

    <section class="post-content">
      <p><h1 id="some-recommendations-for-new-web-developers">Some Recommendations for New (Web) Developers</h1>
<p>Some of these thoughts probably apply to all developers. Some don&#39;t.</p>
<ol>
<li>Learn an editor. It doesn&#39;t matter which editor. Just learn one. Be good at
it. I don&#39;t care if you use Visual Studio or Emacs or whatever. Be really
good at the thing you pick, though.</li>
<li>Learn enough <code>vi</code> to get by. You <em>will</em> need to know it, at some point. At
the very least, learn how to enter text, move around, save, quit, and quit
without saving.</li>
<li>Install <code>jq</code> (build it from source if you want the newest hotness; otherwise
install it with your package manager). Don&#39;t install the <code>jq</code> clones written
in other languages (not C) &mdash; most of them are slow and/or only
half-finished.</li>
<li>Get comfortable with Bash. You don&#39;t have to be great with it, just know
enough to get by. It doesn&#39;t matter what shell you actually use (Zsh, Ksh,
Bash, Sh, Dash, Ash, PowerShell &mdash; I don&#39;t care, whatever). If you&#39;re
writing stuff that&#39;s going to be run by other people, ever, write it in Bash.
If you&#39;re writing stuff that may or may not be run on a server, write it in
POSIX-compliant <code>sh</code>.</li>
<li>Spend some time on Twitter. Facebook is for finding out how your
middle-school best friend&#39;s back surgery went. LinkedIn is for collecting
recruiter spam just in case. Twitter is for following people who say things
that matter, so get on Twitter.</li>
<li>No one cares if you can&#39;t afford a Mac. Macs aren&#39;t great computers, they&#39;re
okay computers that are very expensive. If you can&#39;t afford a Mac, try Linux
(I recommend Debian with the XFCE desktop environment, but try other things
too if you want!). If you don&#39;t have time for that, Windows is also okay
(just remember to tell your editor and Git to use UNIX-style line-endings).</li>
<li>Don&#39;t work (for your employer) on the weekends. Work on side projects, if you
want. Or do other things. Go out to brunch. Climb a mountain. Learn a Primus
song on bass. Get drunk. Just don&#39;t work for the person who pays you to work
during the week. If they seem to expect you to be working when you&#39;re not at
work, start looking for another job.</li>
<li>Learn other languages. HTML and CSS are not programming languages, so they
don&#39;t count. JS is actually a really great language (so don&#39;t take shit from
Java or C# developers who bitch about it!), but it&#39;s only one language. Learn
another language that helps you think about what you do in a different way.
Scheme (specifically, Racket) is a really nice one to start with. Haskell is
interesting (or some other ML-type language, like OCaml or Purescript). C is
also really useful to know, even if you only ever learn enough to write a
basic shell or something.</li>
<li>Figure out your own method for managing tasks. Chances are, you&#39;ll work for
more than one company over the next few years. Your employer might be really
into Jira, or Trello, or whatever, or they might change their mind four times
a year, but either way, getting heavily invested in one tool is not a great
idea. Use their thing, but also figure out what works for you. I keep track
of tasks for work in plain Markdown files, and I use
<a href="http://npm.im/lilnote">lilnote</a> for personal tasks. Just find a thing you
like and stick with it.</li>
<li>Make time for personal development. Including on the clock. If your employer
doesn&#39;t like that you spend a half hour every morning catching up on what new
flags Chromium shipped, or competing on Codewars, or whatever other technical
thing happens to really interest you but might also benefit your company,
start looking for another job.</li>

         | tags: <a href="/tag/react/">react</a>, <a href="/tag/proptypes/">proptypes</a>, <a href="/tag/classnames/">classnames</a></span>

      <br>

    </header>
    <section class="post-content">
      <p><p>The <a href="https://npmjs.com/package/classnames">classnames</a> library is nice.
It lets you do stuff like</p>
<pre class="hljs"><code><span class="hljs-keyword">import</span> cn <span class="hljs-keyword">from</span> <span class="hljs-string">&#39;classnames&#39;</span>
<span class="hljs-keyword">import</span> styles <span class="hljs-keyword">from</span> <span class="hljs-string">&#39;./styles.css&#39;</span>

<span class="hljs-keyword">const</span> Thing = ({ foo }) =&gt;
  &lt;Stuff className={cn(styles.thing, { [styles.foo]: foo !== <span class="hljs-number">2</span> })} /&gt;</code></pre><p>And a whole bunch of other stuff, and it just works. If you write your CSS
in CSS, you should check it out.</p>
<p>There is one sort of pain point with it, though. If you have components that
can take anything that&#39;s <code>classnames</code>-compatible, PropTypes get a little annoying.</p>
<pre class="hljs"><code><span class="hljs-constant">Stuff.propTypes</span> = { className: <span class="hljs-built_in">string</span>.isRequired }</code></pre><p>This doesn&#39;t work, because you&#39;re passing all sorts of stuff in, possibly.</p>
<p>A solution is to make your own custom PropTypes. You don&#39;t even need to
get into fancy stuff involving validation, just combine a bunch of other
PropTypes into your own.</p>
<p>Let&#39;s say you have a <code>propTypes.js</code> file somewhere where you define custom
PropTypes.</p>
<pre class="hljs"><code>import { PropTypes } <span class="hljs-keyword">from</span> <span class="hljs-string">&#39;react&#39;</span>

export <span class="hljs-keyword">const</span> classname = PropTypes.oneOfType([
  PropTypes.<span class="hljs-keyword">object</span>,
  PropTypes.<span class="hljs-keyword">string</span>,
  PropTypes.arrayOf(
    PropTypes.oneOfType([
      PropTypes.array,
      PropTypes.<span class="hljs-keyword">bool</span>,
      PropTypes.<span class="hljs-keyword">object</span>,
      PropTypes.<span class="hljs-keyword">string</span>
    ])
  )
])</code></pre><p>That&#39;s all you need! Then you can do:</p>
<pre class="hljs"><code>import { <span class="hljs-built_in">classname</span> } <span class="hljs-keyword">from</span> <span class="hljs-string">&#39;./propTypes&#39;</span>
import cn <span class="hljs-keyword">from</span> <span class="hljs-string">&#39;classnames&#39;</span>

const Stuff = ({ <span class="hljs-built_in">className</span> }) =&gt;
  &lt;span <span class="hljs-built_in">className</span>={cn(<span class="hljs-built_in">className</span>)}&gt;

Stuff.propTypes = {
  <span class="hljs-built_in">className</span>: <span class="hljs-built_in">classname</span> <span class="hljs-comment">// this is your custom thing</span>
}</code></pre><p>That should solve all PropTypes warnings and let you throw anything the
<code>classnames</code> library can handle at your components.</p>
