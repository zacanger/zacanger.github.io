      <p><p>This was originally posted
<a href="https://github.com/lukeschunk/Notebook/blob/master/DailyNotes/Three_Quick_Tips.md">here</a>
by <a href="https://twitter.com/LukeSchunk">Luke Schunk</a>, but I wanted to repost because
there&#39;s some good stuff in here, and because he doesn&#39;t actually, like, share
links to his notes.</p>

<h2 id="three-quick-tips-for-succeeding-at-a-bootcamp">Three Quick Tips for Succeeding at A Bootcamp</h2>
<p>I recently graduated from DevMountain, a 12-week immersive web development
bootcamp with campuses in Provo, Salt Lake, and Dallas. I had an overwhelmingly
positive experience, and I landed a great job soon after graduation. So for me,
the bootcamp was a good choice. I&#39;ve noticed this disparity, though, between
people who attend bootcamps and have a positive experience, and people who have
a negative one. Oftentimes this negativity is caused by inability to find a job
after finishing up a bootcamp.</p>
<p>Here are three tips to help you end up in the column of success stories.</p>
<h3 id="enjoy-what-you-do">Enjoy What You Do</h3>
<p>Perhaps this sounds obvious, but I was surprised about how many people signed up
to go to a bootcamp without having any idea of whether or not they liked
programming. Some people are lured in by the prospects of landing a shiny new
job, and I get that. It&#39;s a tempting idea. But, if you don&#39;t enjoy what you&#39;re
doing, it&#39;s going to be very hard to succeed. Even if you can get through the
bootcamp and land a job, why would you want to start a career doing something
you don&#39;t enjoy? I spent several months teaching myself to code before going to
the bootcamp, so by the time the first day of class came around, I already had a
healthy enjoyment for programming.</p>
<h3 id="set-yourself-apart">Set Yourself Apart</h3>
<p>In a nutshell, the way I landed my job was by learning and doing something that
almost nobody in my cohort did. I learned ReactJS, which was not taught heavily
as curriculum at the time I attended DevMountain. Really diving into React on my
own enabled me to contribute to some open source components at MX (a startup in
Utah). When I applied for the apprenticeship at MX, they received a slew of
other talented applicants, but I was able to land the job. This was largely due
to the fact that they had a rapport with me via back-and-forth communication in
pull requests, and my open source contributions gave them confidence I could
contribute to their codebase. There are a lot of ways to set yourself apart -
learn something different, build something different, contribute to open source,
etc. Find something that interests you and dive in.</p>
<h3 id="make-connections">Make Connections</h3>
<p>I prefer the phrase make-connections over &#39;network&#39;. I hate the idea of
business-type-people mingling over cocktails and that&#39;s what I used to think of
when I heard the word network. What I&#39;ve found though, is making connections
doesn&#39;t have to be uncomfortable. Twitter can be an extremely useful tool for
chatting with prominent developers in your area, and you can also ask them an
occasional question. So not only can you make connections and form
relationships, but also you can get some help from experts in the field. Forming
relationships on twitter enabled me to speak at my first meetup.</p>
<p>Twitter isn&#39;t the only way to have success with this. I&#39;ve connected with people
over linkedin and in person as well. Find what works for you. One last tip on
this - it&#39;s a lot easier to network when you <em>arent</em> desperate for a job. When
you reach out to someone while you&#39;re looking for a job, no matter how well your
intentions are, it might come across like you&#39;re looking for a handout. I
addressed this by networking very early in the bootcamp, so the pressure of
finding a job was lifted.</p>
<p>This isn&#39;t a ground breaking list of tips, but I was surprised to see people who
failed to do one or multiple of these things. Give it a go, and I wish you the
best of luck in your new journey as a developer!</p>

<h4 id="-including-some-really-obvious-ones-but-i-just-want-to-make-it-all-clear-">(including some really obvious ones, but i just want to make it all clear)</h4>
<ul>
<li>allow navigation of projects</li>
<li>enable editing of source code</li>
<li>detect syntax of languages (through extension is okay)</li>
<li>integrate with compiler(s)/interpreter(s), CI, REPL(s) (depending on language specificity of the editor)</li>
<li>allow for community collaborative effort to build/maintain language &amp; feature support</li>
<li>integrate with modern development tools/environments (browsers, source control, deployment, etc)</li>
<li>allow for non-code (text, hints, live previews, etc) !!</li>
<li>allow for collaboration <em>within</em> editor (realtime remote connection) !!</li>
<li>interpret code as it is typed; show results locally !!</li>
<li>abstract <em>above</em> just a normal directory tree for navigation/code organization !!</li>
</ul>
<p>!! -- almost certainly only through extensibility (packages/plugins), and even then these are pretty far-out goals,
technologically. the last two are especially difficult, even conceptually, and would need a lot of HCI design research
before even prototyping.</p>
<h3 id="notes-from-brett-victor-s-talks-and-such">notes from brett victor&#39;s talks and such</h3>
<ul>
<li>Information Design two big rules: Show the data, and show comparisons.</li>
<li>Larry Tesler: personal vendetta against modes in software. &#39;Don\&#39;t mode me in.&#39;</li>
<li>He&#39;s the reason we have straight-up WYSIWYG editing and stuff.</li>
<li>His editor was called &#39;Gypsy.&#39; Click and drag? That&#39;s him.</li>
<li>Cut, copy, and paste: that&#39;s him.</li>
<li>That&#39;s funny, kinda, because the best software is still moded.</li>
<li>This is curious, because to everyone else at the time, modes were just a way of life
with computing. This wasn&#39;t a problem to anyone else, just to him.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="on-version-control-and-ot-and-eve-in-general">on version control and ot and eve in general</h2>
<ul>
<li>Recording changes as they happen is easier than inferring them after the fact.</li>
<li>Preserving history (the context in which a change was made) is necessary for proper merges.</li>
<li>Being predictable is more important than being smart.</li>
<li>Partial edits, merge conflicts, etc. prevent only that current view/component/whatever from running,
rather than the whole thing.</li>
