    <section class="post-content">
      <p><p>I have, like, an actual kind of tip, for new-ish developers.</p>
<p>It&#39;s pretty simple. Shouldn&#39;t be too hard to grasp, maybe a little harder to
implement.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Have confidence in your code.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>If you don&#39;t have confidence in your code, then try this:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Write code in which you have confience.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It really sucks to have to walk someone through your  code when you&#39;re not
sure it&#39;s even doing the things it&#39;s supposed to do, or when you <em>are</em> sure
it&#39;s doing the right things but doing them in a really gross kind of way.</p>
<p>I think this is something everyone struggles with. It&#39;s really easy to copy
and paste stuff from StackOverflow, and everyone does it for a while. I still
do it sometimes, though usually with a lot of testing and reading before
actually running that code.</p>
<p>It&#39;s really easy, as a new dev, to say &quot;Well, I don&#39;t know how to do that thing,
can you just show me?&quot; And that&#39;s okay, but it&#39;s a lot more okay to say &quot;Hey,
I spent an hour with the docs, here&#39;s my implementation, here&#39;s the stack trace
and I couldn&#39;t find anything helpful on the source&#39;s issues or SO, do you have
any ideas?&quot;</p>
<p>It takes a while to write code that you don&#39;t hate, but usually even someone
who&#39;s been programming for a few months knows what good code looks like. It&#39;s
concise, readable, logical, and consistent. It doesn&#39;t make you cringe.</p>
<p>I&#39;m not really very good at writing code and feeling great about it. When it
comes to, say, raw Node or a Bash script, I&#39;m usually better with these things
than anyone I know on a personal level, and have no problem taking charge and
just doing things. But when it comes to the things I actually do every day
(which right now means React, Koa, AWS stuff, Docker, trying to read C#, and
Sass, mostly) I know I&#39;m not that great. Knowing that I&#39;m not that great means
I take probably twice as long as I would to get anything done as I would if I
was the best at that thing in the room, because I know people who know more
than I do will be looking at my code and will need to fix it.</p>
<p>That&#39;s not a <strong>bad</strong> thing, but it&#39;s not a good thing either. It means I&#39;m
programming without confidence, when I&#39;m writing React or Sass. And I&#39;m not
even <em>bad</em> at either, I just have no confidence when writing these things
on a project with people who are better at them than I am. That&#39;s something
that I should get over.</p>
<p>Anyway, I meant to write this post on the train and post it when I got home,
but I ended up standing on the train so it&#39;s split, from while waiting for the
train &#39;til 10:30 PM while sitting at DevMountain, so it&#39;s probably a little
disjointed.</p>
<p>The point here is, if you have confidence in what you&#39;re doing, you&#39;ll get
stuff done quicker and better, and if you don&#39;t have confidence in what you&#39;re
doing, make it so that you can.</p>

<li>Five steps to understanding a new code base:<ul>
<li>Find a mentor who really understands that code base and is willing and able to take the
time to talk to you about it.</li>
<li>Get an overview of the codebase from said mentor, on style, frameworks, libs, architecture,
etc. for all of it, then go study all those things <em>apart</em> from the current code so you
know how they&#39;re all supposed to work. Also find out the history of the code.</li>
<li>Complete a task. A tiny feature or bugfix or something.</li>
<li>Don&#39;t get stuck. If you&#39;re not getting anything done for more than like a half hour or
whatever and you can&#39;t figure it out, <em>ask that mentor</em>.</li>

<h3 id="functors">FUNCTORS</h3>
<p>I don&#39;t really know what a functor is but apparently map and filter are functors.</p>
<p>Functors are objects that have a map-type method. Not the method itself.</p>
<p>A JS array is a functor. Same with promises (from libraries, not the spec!) and streams.</p>

      <p><h1 id="deploying-docker-images">Deploying Docker Images</h1>
<p>You can use Docker&#39;s repos. That&#39;s the easy way so I won&#39;t talk about it here.
There are loads of good docs out there on that, and anyway, it&#39;s built into the
tools. Instead this post deals with deployment of images that you can&#39;t publish
(like your company&#39;s code).</p>
<h2 id="the-non-repo-way">The non-repo way</h2>
<p>This way doesn&#39;t give you any of the nice features of having a repo, but it&#39;s
also much easier to deal with.</p>
<p>First export your (running) container. Do a <code>docker ps</code> to get its name or ID,
then <code>docker export &lt;that-name&gt; &gt; foo.tar</code>.</p>
<p>Then you&#39;ll want to get it to your server (using <code>sftp</code> or whatever else works
for you). On the server, do a <code>cat foo.tar | docker import -</code></p>
<p>Boom, it&#39;s there. You can run it the same way you would normally (like <code>docker
run -p 80:80 -d foo</code> or whatever).</p>
<h2 id="the-your-own-repo-way">The your-own-repo way</h2>
<p>This is a little more difficult, but you get to keep all the benefits of a
Docker repo without making stuff public.</p>
<p>Get your own repo with <code>docker run -p 5000:5000 samalba/docker-registry</code>.</p>
<p>Hurray, once that&#39;s done you&#39;ll have your own Docker registry running!</p>
<p>Do something like <code>docker login localhost:5000</code> and set up some login
credentials.</p>
<p>To push your stuff to it, first tag it with info, like <code>docker tag
mycompany/theirprivatecode localhost:5000/mycompany/theirprivatecode</code>.</p>
<p>Do use this repo, just use <code>docker push
localhost:5000/mycompany/theirprivatecode</code> instead of pushing to a public repo.</p>
<p>You&#39;ll want to do a <code>docker ps</code> and get the container ID for your local
registry, and commit that so you don&#39;t lose your stuff. Or you can use <code>-v</code> or
set up volumes.</p>
<p>You&#39;ll want to do a <code>docker ps</code> and get the container ID for your local
registry, and commit that so you don&#39;t lose your stuff. Or you can use <code>-v</code> or
set up volumes.</p>
<p>Okay, so probably you&#39;ll want to put that somewhere not-on-your-local-machine.
<code>ssh</code> into your server and do an <code>ssh -R 5000:localhost:5000 -l</code> to forwared
that port. Then to deploy forreal, just <code>docker pull
localhost:5000/mycompany/theirprivatecode</code>.</p>
<p>Then to run it you should be able to just <code>docker run
mycompany/theirprivatecode</code>.</p>

<p>methods: possible to define custom</p>
<p>get, put, and delete are really obvious</p>

<p>head: get, but for just meta about the resource</p>

(useful for... cors, i guess)</p>
<p>post: kind of a catch-all for whatever else you want to do rly
it&#39;s not actually intended to be used as the C in CRUD</p>
<p>i may be rethinking my position on url parameters vs queries</p>
<p>remembering, from <a href="http://mdkb.zacanger.com/urls">my docs</a>:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2396.txt">URLs</a> are made up of (usually just some) of these parts:
<code>&lt;scheme&gt;://&lt;username&gt;:&lt;password&gt;@&lt;host&gt;:&lt;port&gt;/&lt;path&gt;;&lt;parameters&gt;?&lt;query&gt;#&lt;fragment&gt;</code>.</p>
<ul>
<li>The scheme is the <em>protocol</em> (http, https, ftp, git, etc.). It ends with <code>:</code> (not <code>//</code>).</li>
<li>The username and password are fairly self-explanitory, and we don&#39;t see that a whole whole lot these days, except
maybe in FTP.</li>
<li>The host is the part we all know well, like &#39;github&#39; or &#39;google.&#39; It can be a domain name or an IP address.</li>
<li>The port (80 for HTTP, 443 for HTTPS, etc.) is self-explanitory; defaults to 80.</li>
<li>The path would be segments (like <code>/doc/search</code> or whatever), and can contain semicolons to separate parameters (like <code>thing=foo;stuff=bar</code>).</li>
<li>Queries can be before or after parameters, and that&#39;d be something like <code>/?q=foo+bar</code>.</li>
<li>Fragments are for specific parts of a resource, like <code>somepage.html#somesection</code>.</li>
<li><code>; / ? : @ &amp; = + $ ,</code> are reserved characters (meaning they have special uses in URLs).</li>
<li><code>- _ . ! ~ * &#39; ( )</code> are unreserved (you can use them almost wherever you&#39;d like).</li>
<li><code>{ } | \\ ^ [ ] \</code> ` are unwise to use in URLs (note that this includes the backslash and backtick/grave, which may not render in Markdown code blocks, depending on parser).</li>
<li><code>&lt; &gt; # % &quot;</code> don&#39;t use these, at all (except the <code>%</code> and <code>#</code> <em>if</em> you have a valid reason for it, because they do special things in URLs).</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<ul>
<li>content headers from client to specify what it can be (accept)</li>
<li>content headers from server to specify what it is (content-type)</li>
</ul>
<p>cache-control, last-modified, and etag to control caching</p>
<p>client will check if-modified-since and if-none-match</p>
<p>accept-encoding (with gzip or compress) yay</p>
<p>on server, max-age and etag ; send 304 if if-no-match matches etag</p>

      <p><p>just a few clojure notes</p>
<p>i don&#39;t know if any of this is vastly different from cljs? i&#39;d think not,
because really you&#39;re just talking about a different target (jvm vs js vm), rite?
but who knows. i mean, normally you wouldn&#39;t talk about clojure and clojurescript
with two different names if they were the exact same language and the only actual
difference was the target vm.</p>
<p>i&#39;d look this up but i&#39;m on a plane. so.</p>
<p>some notes!</p>

<p>did i mention i was on a plane? i wasn&#39;t <em>really</em> on a plane. i&#39;m in an airport.
for a lot of hours. it&#39;s a long story. sort of. it&#39;s actually a relatively short
story, but it&#39;s kind of boring. so whatever.</p>
<p>there are transducers, which are <em>not</em> like a <code>map</code> or <code>functor</code> or whatever.</p>
<p>these are composable transforms</p>
<p>did i mention that i&#39;m in an airport? all night, i&#39;ll be here.
meant to be home by now. in bed. sleeping. having seen the people i really miss,
hugs all around, had a beer, unpacked, showered maybe, gone to bed.
i&#39;ll be home, instead, by maybe noon-ish tomorrow possibly, having missed
another day of work, sweaty and gross, eurgh.</p>
<p>on the other hand i met some nice people suck in this zombie airport, so.</p>
