analogy</p>
<p>here&#39;s a stream-making thingy</p>
<pre class="hljs"><code>const foo = {

    setTimeout(<span class="hljs-function"><span class="hljs-params">()</span> =&gt;</span> cb(<span class="hljs-number">4</span>), <span class="hljs-number">400</span>)
  }
}
foo.each(<span class="hljs-built_in">console</span>.log)</code></pre><p>prototypes are faster than factory functions but geez they&#39;re
kinda gross to think about you know so unless we&#39;re doing something
like making ten million objects just use a factory there i guess</p>
<p>streams are functors</p>
<p>functors are just a thing that implements map</p>
<p>monads are functors that also implement <em>flatMap</em></p>
<p>flatMap just flattens, i guess? that&#39;s what it sounds like.</p>
<p>so like with Promises for example, <code>.then</code> is like <code>.flatMap</code>.
same with stuff like bind and chain methods and stuff. it&#39;s basically
flattening into its <em>value</em> rather than having the actual (semi-expected)
value (function/promise/stream/whatever).</p>
<p>so if you have a flatMap that would return another monad, i guess,
it&#39;d actually return its value, not that other monad.</p>
<p>if you are a tooling addict, don&#39;t do tools. (this actually totally applies to
me, because i&#39;ve spent more time on <a href="https://github.com/zacanger/z.git">my dotfiles</a>
than on any other individual project... <em>but</em> i feel like it&#39;s worth it, mostly.
being able to just use vim and not go through the work of setting up any other
editor on any computer, being able to just clone that repo and symlink what i need,
that really does make me more productive. as long as i don&#39;t forget how to use
computers without my dotfiles, i don&#39;t think they&#39;re really a waste of time.)</p>

<h2 id="three-quick-tips-for-succeeding-at-a-bootcamp">Three Quick Tips for Succeeding at A Bootcamp</h2>
<p>I recently graduated from DevMountain, a 12-week immersive web development
bootcamp with campuses in Provo, Salt Lake, and Dallas. I had an overwhelmingly
positive experience, and I landed a great job soon after graduation. So for me,
the bootcamp was a good choice. I&#39;ve noticed this disparity, though, between
people who attend bootcamps and have a positive experience, and people who have
a negative one. Oftentimes this negativity is caused by inability to find a job
after finishing up a bootcamp.</p>
<p>Here are three tips to help you end up in the column of success stories.</p>
<h3 id="enjoy-what-you-do">Enjoy What You Do</h3>
<p>Perhaps this sounds obvious, but I was surprised about how many people signed up
to go to a bootcamp without having any idea of whether or not they liked
programming. Some people are lured in by the prospects of landing a shiny new
job, and I get that. It&#39;s a tempting idea. But, if you don&#39;t enjoy what you&#39;re
doing, it&#39;s going to be very hard to succeed. Even if you can get through the
bootcamp and land a job, why would you want to start a career doing something
you don&#39;t enjoy? I spent several months teaching myself to code before going to
the bootcamp, so by the time the first day of class came around, I already had a
healthy enjoyment for programming.</p>
<h3 id="set-yourself-apart">Set Yourself Apart</h3>
<p>In a nutshell, the way I landed my job was by learning and doing something that
almost nobody in my cohort did. I learned ReactJS, which was not taught heavily
as curriculum at the time I attended DevMountain. Really diving into React on my
own enabled me to contribute to some open source components at MX (a startup in
Utah). When I applied for the apprenticeship at MX, they received a slew of
other talented applicants, but I was able to land the job. This was largely due
to the fact that they had a rapport with me via back-and-forth communication in
pull requests, and my open source contributions gave them confidence I could
contribute to their codebase. There are a lot of ways to set yourself apart -
learn something different, build something different, contribute to open source,
etc. Find something that interests you and dive in.</p>
<h3 id="make-connections">Make Connections</h3>
<p>I prefer the phrase make-connections over &#39;network&#39;. I hate the idea of
business-type-people mingling over cocktails and that&#39;s what I used to think of
when I heard the word network. What I&#39;ve found though, is making connections
doesn&#39;t have to be uncomfortable. Twitter can be an extremely useful tool for
chatting with prominent developers in your area, and you can also ask them an
occasional question. So not only can you make connections and form
relationships, but also you can get some help from experts in the field. Forming
relationships on twitter enabled me to speak at my first meetup.</p>
<p>Twitter isn&#39;t the only way to have success with this. I&#39;ve connected with people
over linkedin and in person as well. Find what works for you. One last tip on
this - it&#39;s a lot easier to network when you <em>arent</em> desperate for a job. When
you reach out to someone while you&#39;re looking for a job, no matter how well your
intentions are, it might come across like you&#39;re looking for a handout. I
addressed this by networking very early in the bootcamp, so the pressure of
finding a job was lifted.</p>
<p>This isn&#39;t a ground breaking list of tips, but I was surprised to see people who
failed to do one or multiple of these things. Give it a go, and I wish you the
best of luck in your new journey as a developer!</p>

<li>integrate with modern development tools/environments (browsers, source control, deployment, etc)</li>
<li>allow for non-code (text, hints, live previews, etc) !!</li>

<li>interpret code as it is typed; show results locally !!</li>
<li>abstract <em>above</em> just a normal directory tree for navigation/code organization !!</li>
</ul>
<p>!! -- almost certainly only through extensibility (packages/plugins), and even then these are pretty far-out goals,
technologically. the last two are especially difficult, even conceptually, and would need a lot of HCI design research
before even prototyping.</p>

<p>It&#39;s pretty simple. Shouldn&#39;t be too hard to grasp, maybe a little harder to
implement.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Have confidence in your code.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>If you don&#39;t have confidence in your code, then try this:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Write code in which you have confience.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It really sucks to have to walk someone through your  code when you&#39;re not
sure it&#39;s even doing the things it&#39;s supposed to do, or when you <em>are</em> sure
it&#39;s doing the right things but doing them in a really gross kind of way.</p>
<p>I think this is something everyone struggles with. It&#39;s really easy to copy
and paste stuff from StackOverflow, and everyone does it for a while. I still
do it sometimes, though usually with a lot of testing and reading before
actually running that code.</p>
<p>It&#39;s really easy, as a new dev, to say &quot;Well, I don&#39;t know how to do that thing,
can you just show me?&quot; And that&#39;s okay, but it&#39;s a lot more okay to say &quot;Hey,
I spent an hour with the docs, here&#39;s my implementation, here&#39;s the stack trace
and I couldn&#39;t find anything helpful on the source&#39;s issues or SO, do you have
any ideas?&quot;</p>
<p>It takes a while to write code that you don&#39;t hate, but usually even someone
who&#39;s been programming for a few months knows what good code looks like. It&#39;s
concise, readable, logical, and consistent. It doesn&#39;t make you cringe.</p>
<p>I&#39;m not really very good at writing code and feeling great about it. When it
comes to, say, raw Node or a Bash script, I&#39;m usually better with these things
than anyone I know on a personal level, and have no problem taking charge and
just doing things. But when it comes to the things I actually do every day
(which right now means React, Koa, AWS stuff, Docker, trying to read C#, and
Sass, mostly) I know I&#39;m not that great. Knowing that I&#39;m not that great means
I take probably twice as long as I would to get anything done as I would if I
was the best at that thing in the room, because I know people who know more
than I do will be looking at my code and will need to fix it.</p>
<p>That&#39;s not a <strong>bad</strong> thing, but it&#39;s not a good thing either. It means I&#39;m
programming without confidence, when I&#39;m writing React or Sass. And I&#39;m not
even <em>bad</em> at either, I just have no confidence when writing these things
on a project with people who are better at them than I am. That&#39;s something
that I should get over.</p>
<p>Anyway, I meant to write this post on the train and post it when I got home,
but I ended up standing on the train so it&#39;s split, from while waiting for the
train &#39;til 10:30 PM while sitting at DevMountain, so it&#39;s probably a little
disjointed.</p>
<p>The point here is, if you have confidence in what you&#39;re doing, you&#39;ll get
stuff done quicker and better, and if you don&#39;t have confidence in what you&#39;re
doing, make it so that you can.</p>

<p>Dear Zac: Please start writing tests. Thanks! Love, Zac.</p>
<p>&#39;The Overjustification Effect&#39; ... side projects are valuable in multiple ways.
(I think everyone knew this.)</p>
<p>Clojure: in parens, operator and operands. Example: (doThings toThis andThis andThis andThis).</p>
<p>APPARENTLY I know 90% of Clojure, now. Cool. Can someone please explain to me why cljs has
brackets and braces, then? Like... wat?</p>
<ul>
<li>Five steps to understanding a new code base:<ul>
<li>Find a mentor who really understands that code base and is willing and able to take the
time to talk to you about it.</li>
<li>Get an overview of the codebase from said mentor, on style, frameworks, libs, architecture,
etc. for all of it, then go study all those things <em>apart</em> from the current code so you
know how they&#39;re all supposed to work. Also find out the history of the code.</li>
<li>Complete a task. A tiny feature or bugfix or something.</li>
<li>Don&#39;t get stuck. If you&#39;re not getting anything done for more than like a half hour or
whatever and you can&#39;t figure it out, <em>ask that mentor</em>.</li>
<li>Code review, review, review code, code, code review.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="functors">FUNCTORS</h3>
<p>I don&#39;t really know what a functor is but apparently map and filter are functors.</p>
<p>Functors are objects that have a map-type method. Not the method itself.</p>
<p>A JS array is a functor. Same with promises (from libraries, not the spec!) and streams.</p>

<p>You can use Docker&#39;s repos. That&#39;s the easy way so I won&#39;t talk about it here.
There are loads of good docs out there on that, and anyway, it&#39;s built into the
tools. Instead this post deals with deployment of images that you can&#39;t publish
(like your company&#39;s code).</p>
<h2 id="the-non-repo-way">The non-repo way</h2>
<p>This way doesn&#39;t give you any of the nice features of having a repo, but it&#39;s
also much easier to deal with.</p>
<p>First export your (running) container. Do a <code>docker ps</code> to get its name or ID,
then <code>docker export &lt;that-name&gt; &gt; foo.tar</code>.</p>
<p>Then you&#39;ll want to get it to your server (using <code>sftp</code> or whatever else works
for you). On the server, do a <code>cat foo.tar | docker import -</code></p>
<p>Boom, it&#39;s there. You can run it the same way you would normally (like <code>docker
run -p 80:80 -d foo</code> or whatever).</p>
<h2 id="the-your-own-repo-way">The your-own-repo way</h2>
<p>This is a little more difficult, but you get to keep all the benefits of a
Docker repo without making stuff public.</p>
<p>Get your own repo with <code>docker run -p 5000:5000 samalba/docker-registry</code>.</p>
<p>Hurray, once that&#39;s done you&#39;ll have your own Docker registry running!</p>
<p>Do something like <code>docker login localhost:5000</code> and set up some login
credentials.</p>
<p>To push your stuff to it, first tag it with info, like <code>docker tag
mycompany/theirprivatecode localhost:5000/mycompany/theirprivatecode</code>.</p>
<p>Do use this repo, just use <code>docker push
localhost:5000/mycompany/theirprivatecode</code> instead of pushing to a public repo.</p>
<p>You&#39;ll want to do a <code>docker ps</code> and get the container ID for your local
registry, and commit that so you don&#39;t lose your stuff. Or you can use <code>-v</code> or
set up volumes.</p>
<p>You&#39;ll want to do a <code>docker ps</code> and get the container ID for your local
registry, and commit that so you don&#39;t lose your stuff. Or you can use <code>-v</code> or
set up volumes.</p>
<p>Okay, so probably you&#39;ll want to put that somewhere not-on-your-local-machine.
<code>ssh</code> into your server and do an <code>ssh -R 5000:localhost:5000 -l</code> to forwared
that port. Then to deploy forreal, just <code>docker pull
localhost:5000/mycompany/theirprivatecode</code>.</p>
<p>Then to run it you should be able to just <code>docker run
mycompany/theirprivatecode</code>.</p>

<p>representations: dictionaries of actual resources</p>
<p>eh?</p>
<p>example: url: foo.bar/video with:
representations: various formats and sizes of said video</p>
<p>methods: possible to define custom</p>
<p>get, put, and delete are really obvious</p>
<p>patch: like put, but for small changes</p>
<p>head: get, but for just meta about the resource</p>
<p>options: what all can i even do with this thing?
(useful for... cors, i guess)</p>
<p>post: kind of a catch-all for whatever else you want to do rly
it&#39;s not actually intended to be used as the C in CRUD</p>
<p>i may be rethinking my position on url parameters vs queries</p>
<p>remembering, from <a href="http://mdkb.zacanger.com/urls">my docs</a>:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2396.txt">URLs</a> are made up of (usually just some) of these parts:
<code>&lt;scheme&gt;://&lt;username&gt;:&lt;password&gt;@&lt;host&gt;:&lt;port&gt;/&lt;path&gt;;&lt;parameters&gt;?&lt;query&gt;#&lt;fragment&gt;</code>.</p>
<ul>
<li>The scheme is the <em>protocol</em> (http, https, ftp, git, etc.). It ends with <code>:</code> (not <code>//</code>).</li>
<li>The username and password are fairly self-explanitory, and we don&#39;t see that a whole whole lot these days, except
maybe in FTP.</li>
<li>The host is the part we all know well, like &#39;github&#39; or &#39;google.&#39; It can be a domain name or an IP address.</li>
<li>The port (80 for HTTP, 443 for HTTPS, etc.) is self-explanitory; defaults to 80.</li>
<li>The path would be segments (like <code>/doc/search</code> or whatever), and can contain semicolons to separate parameters (like <code>thing=foo;stuff=bar</code>).</li>
<li>Queries can be before or after parameters, and that&#39;d be something like <code>/?q=foo+bar</code>.</li>
<li>Fragments are for specific parts of a resource, like <code>somepage.html#somesection</code>.</li>
<li><code>; / ? : @ &amp; = + $ ,</code> are reserved characters (meaning they have special uses in URLs).</li>
<li><code>- _ . ! ~ * &#39; ( )</code> are unreserved (you can use them almost wherever you&#39;d like).</li>
<li><code>{ } | \\ ^ [ ] \</code> ` are unwise to use in URLs (note that this includes the backslash and backtick/grave, which may not render in Markdown code blocks, depending on parser).</li>
<li><code>&lt; &gt; # % &quot;</code> don&#39;t use these, at all (except the <code>%</code> and <code>#</code> <em>if</em> you have a valid reason for it, because they do special things in URLs).</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<ul>
<li>content headers from client to specify what it can be (accept)</li>
<li>content headers from server to specify what it is (content-type)</li>
</ul>
<p>cache-control, last-modified, and etag to control caching</p>
<p>client will check if-modified-since and if-none-match</p>
<p>accept-encoding (with gzip or compress) yay</p>
<p>on server, max-age and etag ; send 304 if if-no-match matches etag</p>

<p>i don&#39;t know if any of this is vastly different from cljs? i&#39;d think not,
because really you&#39;re just talking about a different target (jvm vs js vm), rite?
but who knows. i mean, normally you wouldn&#39;t talk about clojure and clojurescript
with two different names if they were the exact same language and the only actual
difference was the target vm.</p>

<p>did i mention i was on a plane? i wasn&#39;t <em>really</em> on a plane. i&#39;m in an airport.
for a lot of hours. it&#39;s a long story. sort of. it&#39;s actually a relatively short
story, but it&#39;s kind of boring. so whatever.</p>
<p>there are transducers, which are <em>not</em> like a <code>map</code> or <code>functor</code> or whatever.</p>
<p>these are composable transforms</p>
<p>did i mention that i&#39;m in an airport? all night, i&#39;ll be here.
meant to be home by now. in bed. sleeping. having seen the people i really miss,
hugs all around, had a beer, unpacked, showered maybe, gone to bed.
i&#39;ll be home, instead, by maybe noon-ish tomorrow possibly, having missed
another day of work, sweaty and gross, eurgh.</p>
<p>on the other hand i met some nice people suck in this zombie airport, so.</p>

things in incredibly slow/unproductive ways. i know everyone has their own
ways of being awesome, and most of those ways are much more awesome ways than
the ways in which i am okay at things, but still, there are better ways, and
most developers i&#39;ve seen just have <em>no</em> idea how much time they waste.</p>
<p>so here are just some tiny little tips. none of these are big news, none
are esoteric, none are risky, all require a little bit of work but make things
a lot faster in a very short period of time.</p>
<h2 id="bash-things">bash things</h2>
<p>you can use zsh, and that&#39;s a thing, and it doesn&#39;t suck, okay, but it pays
to be good at bash. bash is everywhere. it&#39;s the default shell on just about
every system. zsh gives you nice things, but you can get all the same nice
things in bash with just a tiny bit of work.</p>
<p>the number one most useful thing to do with bash is aliases, i think.
it&#39;s generally recommended that you use functions if you can, but there&#39;s
really no harm in using aliases. try these out, for example:</p>
<pre class="hljs"><code><span class="hljs-keyword">alias</span> <span class="hljs-title">ns</span>=<span class="hljs-comment">&#39;npm start&#39;</span>
<span class="hljs-keyword">alias</span> <span class="hljs-title">nt</span>=<span class="hljs-comment">&#39;npm test&#39;</span>

<p>for that matter, there&#39;s the aliases up there... npm has a bunch built-in.
for example, you never need to type out <code>npm install --save-dev</code>

<p>npm gives you a million things. just read the docs sometime. or the help screens.</p>
<h2 id="the-terminal">the terminal</h2>
<p>use readline stuff. ctrl-w, ctrl-a, ctrl-e, even just those, just use them. ctrl-arrow

<p>set your prompt up to tell you nice stuff. i <em>highly</em> recommend using liquidprompt
(<code>apt-get install -y liquidprompt</code> or <code>brew install liquidprompt</code>), but you can
also do all these things manually (check
<a href="https://github.com/zacanger/z/blob/master/.bashrc#L127">my dotfiles</a> for examples).</p>
<p>pick a bookmarking system and stick with it. <a href="https://github.com/wting/autojump">there</a>
<a href="https://github.com/rupa/z">are</a> a <a href="https://github.com/shyiko/commacd">bunch</a> of them

<h2 id="markdown">markdown</h2>
<p>if you don&#39;t use it, use it. if you still click around in microsoft word or google docs,
goddamn, take two minutes to learn the easiest and most popular plain-to-rich-text
lightweight-markup authoring format out there. it&#39;s the only way to write, really.</p>
<h2 id="your-editor">your editor</h2>
<p>i don&#39;t care what your editor is. i really don&#39;t. i know just enough about lisp
to not even hate emacs users. i do dislike VS Code, but mostly because of the
idiotic and transparent licensing scheme. and also because it&#39;s not a very
good editor. but the built-in debugger isn&#39;t bad (you can get all the same things
from other tools, but it is better than the ones that you can get for most other
editors for node).</p>
<p>whatever your editor is, take a week to learn it really well. in my case, finally
just spending some time getting <em>fluid</em> with vim has made a huge difference.
i no longer have any other editors installed (and i tried a lot of them! i loved
<a href="http://lighttable.com/">LightTable</a> and <a href="http://foicica.com/textadept/">Textadept</a>
especially, and also really liked atom (but it&#39;s <em>slow</em>); brackets was a waste of
my time, sublime was okay but nonfree and there&#39;s textadept so whatever, see above
for notes on VS code; actual IDEs i tent to avoid because they&#39;re just overwhelmingly
large and in the way all the time, to me). that doesn&#39;t mean vim&#39;s the <em>best</em> editor
(though it totally is), it just means it&#39;s the one i decided i wanted use, and it&#39;s
the absolute best tool that i have now because i&#39;m pretty quick with it.</p>
<p>even if you use vs code or brackets (i&#39;d advise you not to do so, but it&#39;s up to
you...), just take the time to learn your editor well. learn its plugin/extension/
whatever system, find or write a theme that makes things really easy on you, check
out <a href="https://medium.com/@evnbr/coding-in-color-3a6db2743a1e#.5rffb0gto">semantic highlighting</a>
and give that a shot for a week, find a way to open a terminal in your editor
(because you DO need that) if it&#39;s a graphical editor, learn keybinds, learn
configs, and make it work for you. that sounds like a lot of work put into something
that&#39;s not directly <strong>work</strong>, but it&#39;s work invested in yourself being better
at using your tools.</p>
<p>laurie voss, the cto of npm, said in a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NWo-RIHiEJ4">talk</a>
that one of the most important things you can do is be good at your editor.
he&#39;s obviously right. he&#39;s laurie voss.</p>
<h2 id="use-git">use git</h2>
<p>this should be obvious. but, i mean, really use it. use it enough that you
learn how to use a gitconfig, templates, etc., and try out lots of different
extensions and wrappers for git (like hub, legit, ghcli, etc.). do stuff with
git. get really comfortable with git. it&#39;s important. other version control also
matters sometimes in some businesses but really really really spend some time
learning git.</p>
<h2 id="configs">configs</h2>
<p>(<a href="https://github.com/zacanger/z">like these</a>)</p>
<p>organize yours. store them somewhere, like in a repo. because when your current
computer dies (and it will), it&#39;ll take you weeks to get things feeling decent
if you have to recreate everything manually. granted, most people don&#39;t have
dotfiles nearly as extensive as those, but you don&#39;t need to -- i&#39;m a little bit
of a hoarder. disk space is cheap. whatever.</p>

<p>If you don&#39;t know what that means, don&#39;t worry.</p>
<p>There once was a time when browser extensions/add-ons didn&#39;t exist, and a
slightly later time when they did exist but still really sucked. And, I mean,
you can still get a lot more out of arbitrary JS than you can out of an
extension, usually.</p>
<p>Bookmarklets are little bits of JS saved as a bookmark. When you click or
navigate to that bookmark, the browser just executes it. You can do some pretty
nifty things with them. I have <a href="https://pinboard.in/u:zacanger">45748 bookmarks saved on Pinboard</a>,
and the only bookmarks I have in my browsers are little snippets of JavaScript.</p>
<p>I&#39;m not going to post all of them here (I have about 150), just some of the most
useful ones.</p>
<p>You can save any bit of JS you&#39;d like as a bookmark. Just prepend <code>javascript:</code>
to some code, as in <code>javascript:console.log(&#39;foo&#39;);alert(&#39;bar&#39;);</code>.</p>
