<h2 id="three-quick-tips-for-succeeding-at-a-bootcamp">Three Quick Tips for Succeeding at A Bootcamp</h2>
<p>I recently graduated from DevMountain, a 12-week immersive web development
bootcamp with campuses in Provo, Salt Lake, and Dallas. I had an overwhelmingly
positive experience, and I landed a great job soon after graduation. So for me,
the bootcamp was a good choice. I&#39;ve noticed this disparity, though, between
people who attend bootcamps and have a positive experience, and people who have
a negative one. Oftentimes this negativity is caused by inability to find a job
after finishing up a bootcamp.</p>
<p>Here are three tips to help you end up in the column of success stories.</p>
<h3 id="enjoy-what-you-do">Enjoy What You Do</h3>
<p>Perhaps this sounds obvious, but I was surprised about how many people signed up
to go to a bootcamp without having any idea of whether or not they liked
programming. Some people are lured in by the prospects of landing a shiny new
job, and I get that. It&#39;s a tempting idea. But, if you don&#39;t enjoy what you&#39;re
doing, it&#39;s going to be very hard to succeed. Even if you can get through the
bootcamp and land a job, why would you want to start a career doing something
you don&#39;t enjoy? I spent several months teaching myself to code before going to
the bootcamp, so by the time the first day of class came around, I already had a
healthy enjoyment for programming.</p>
<h3 id="set-yourself-apart">Set Yourself Apart</h3>
<p>In a nutshell, the way I landed my job was by learning and doing something that
almost nobody in my cohort did. I learned ReactJS, which was not taught heavily
as curriculum at the time I attended DevMountain. Really diving into React on my
own enabled me to contribute to some open source components at MX (a startup in
Utah). When I applied for the apprenticeship at MX, they received a slew of
other talented applicants, but I was able to land the job. This was largely due
to the fact that they had a rapport with me via back-and-forth communication in
pull requests, and my open source contributions gave them confidence I could
contribute to their codebase. There are a lot of ways to set yourself apart -
learn something different, build something different, contribute to open source,
etc. Find something that interests you and dive in.</p>
<h3 id="make-connections">Make Connections</h3>
<p>I prefer the phrase make-connections over &#39;network&#39;. I hate the idea of
business-type-people mingling over cocktails and that&#39;s what I used to think of
when I heard the word network. What I&#39;ve found though, is making connections
doesn&#39;t have to be uncomfortable. Twitter can be an extremely useful tool for
chatting with prominent developers in your area, and you can also ask them an
occasional question. So not only can you make connections and form
relationships, but also you can get some help from experts in the field. Forming
relationships on twitter enabled me to speak at my first meetup.</p>
<p>Twitter isn&#39;t the only way to have success with this. I&#39;ve connected with people
over linkedin and in person as well. Find what works for you. One last tip on
this - it&#39;s a lot easier to network when you <em>arent</em> desperate for a job. When
you reach out to someone while you&#39;re looking for a job, no matter how well your
intentions are, it might come across like you&#39;re looking for a handout. I
addressed this by networking very early in the bootcamp, so the pressure of
finding a job was lifted.</p>
<p>This isn&#39;t a ground breaking list of tips, but I was surprised to see people who
failed to do one or multiple of these things. Give it a go, and I wish you the
best of luck in your new journey as a developer!</p>

<p>These should be the very last of the notes taken while at DevMountain. I stuck
in like two comments somewhere just because there was something actually
incorrect, but as usual, please don&#39;t take anything in here seriously, there&#39;s a
pretty good chance I didn&#39;t know what I was talking about when I wrote a lot of
this.</p>

like util.format(), but for not-node.</p>
<p>so, you can pass arguments to console.log and console.error that will be passed
to util.format()</p>

<p>Don&#39;t use Mongoose. Mongoose actually does have all the problems I thought it
had. Try Mongolayer at least once. <a href="https://github.com/simpleviewinc/mongolayer">https://github.com/simpleviewinc/mongolayer</a>
<code>npm i --save mongolayer</code></p>
<p>Recursive populates, create vs insert fixed, find/create and save using
different syntax fixed, and each document only having the fields added to it,
rather than being a whole new instance of the schema fixed. Records getting
default values instead of not filling that field fixed. Plus other things.</p>
<hr>
<p>Generators DO look just like infinite loops. I&#39;m not wrong. Turns out that&#39;s
because they are infinite loops, but that&#39;s okay, because they&#39;re basically kind
of backgrounded until called. You hit it up with an iterator, get what you need,
and then it goes back to sleep. So, in a way, maybe that&#39;s kind of like a
builtin thing that you&#39;d imagine needs to be an infinite loop, but isn&#39;t in the
way because you only poke it when you need it. (Like Math.random(), kinda?)
That&#39;s my interpretation, anyway.</p>

<p>Type <em>introspection</em> is a feature of languages where, at runtime (which, for the
sake of keeping it in my head, we&#39;ll say is when said language goes from source
to not-source, whether that&#39;s a binary or a browser window, or whatever... (Java
bytecode doesn&#39;t count, I&#39;m not even sure where it falls on the range of
&#39;scripting&#39; to &#39;compiled&#39;)  a program can take a peek inside and see what the
<em>type</em> of an <em>object</em> is.</p>

<hr>
<h2 id="cron-in-node">Cron in Node</h2>
<p><code>node-schedule</code> seems quite popular. It&#39;s a &#39;cron-like&#39; and &#39;not-cron-like&#39;
scheduler. I believe that means it&#39;s a scheduler, but it&#39;s time based instead of
interval based (because <code>setInterval</code> exists). Node-schedule is for in-process
scheduling, so once your script has executed, it&#39;s gone (and then cron makes a
lot more sense, because otherwise you&#39;d have to write a script just to start
node-schedule to do whatever it is that you need done at whatever time and/or
date).</p>

<h2 id="electron-vs-node-webkit">Electron vs Node Webkit</h2>
<ul>
<li>Electron: <code>main</code> in <code>package.json</code> is the <code>app.js</code> or whatever to run.</li>
<li>nw.js: <code>main</code> is the <code>index.html</code> to display.</li>
<li>nw.js: can specify options about window, such as toolbar, width, and height.</li>
<li>electron: you do that in the app.js or whatever.</li>
<li>electron&#39;s menus are available on the main process. for dynamic updates to menus from within the app (rendering process), need to use ipc (built-in to electron).</li>
<li>nw: call set menu, and set stuff. it&#39;s all bundled anyway, so whatever.</li>
<li>nw: shell calls are totally fine.</li>
<li>electron: need to spawn child procs with the <code>pipe</code> stdio option.</li>
</ul>
<p>A package for nw.js is a zip archive wit hthe extension &#39;nw.&#39; There must be a
package.json, which includes the &#39;main&#39; key (html to open on load), and name of
package (similar to node modules).</p>
<p>&#39;nodejs&#39; field on package.json is boolean; set false to disable node running
there (purely client-side). node-main is the path to the script for node to run
(so we could have nodde run the server, and nwjs working with its own files, and
there _shouldn&#39;t- be conflict.)</p>
<ul>
<li>user-agent (should be pretty obvious.)</li>
<li>remote enalbes calling node in remote pages, whitelist of hostnames.</li>
<li>chromium-args (literally).</li>
<li>js-flags (string) for example:<code>{&quot;name&quot;: &quot;test&quot;, &quot;main&quot;: &quot;index.html&quot;, &quot;js-flags&quot;: etc function etc}</code></li>
<li><p>inject-js-start and inject-js-end (THESE ARE THE IMPORTANT BITS, PAY ATTENTION HERE!)</p>
<ul>
<li>start: local filename (relative to index.html) to specify js to inject. js is executed AFTER all css, but BEFORE any other scripts are run or the dom is built.</li>
<li>end: same, but it&#39;s excecuted AFTER loaded, before the onload event. mostly used as an option of Window.open() to inject js into a new window.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>window:</p>
<ul>
<li>title str</li>
<li>width/height int</li>

</ul>
<p>More on nw stuff:</p>
<p>whether a .nw file (renamed zip) or project directory, the package.json needs to
be in the root, and if it&#39;s the .nw, that needs to be the actual project
directory contents, not a directory containing them.</p>
<p><code>console.log</code> redirects to dev tools (same with console.warn and console.error)</p>
<p>the <code>process</code> object:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>process.versions[&#39;node-webkit&#39;]</code> is set with nw&#39;s version<ul>
<li><code>process.versions[&#39;chromium&#39;]</code> is set with the chromium version that the nw version is based on (so, for example, node-webkit version 0.13.0-alpha7, chromium version 47.0.2526.73, node version 5.1.0)</li>
<li><code>process.mainModule</code> is set to the <em>start</em> page, eg <code>index.html</code>--this is whatever&#39;s under <code>main</code> in the package.json, UNLESS there&#39;s a specified <code>node-main</code> field there.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p><code>__dirname</code> can only be called by node modules (with <code>require()</code>). webkit doesn&#39;t have that (not in devtools either). a hacky fix:</p>
<p><code>exports.dirname = __dirname</code> in a file, then require that (eg <code>var dirname = require(&#39;./dirnamefile&#39;).dirname; console.log(dirname)</code> would return dirname).</p>
<hr>
<h1 id="misc-node-things">MISC NODE THINGS</h1>
<p>What the hell is an event emitter, anyway? Oh, okay. So. Here&#39;s an example.
<code>net.Server</code> emits an event when a peer connects. <code>fs.readStream</code> emits an event
when a file is opened. <code>events.EventEmitter</code> objects! This can be accessed
directly by requiring <code>events</code>.</p>
<p>Functions can be executed when an event is emitted--these are called
<strong>listeners</strong> (not something silly like emitter methods or whatever, that would
just be nonsense). In those functions, <code>this</code> is the <code>EventEmitter</code> to which the
listener is attached.</p>
<p>Something worth noting: <em>HANDLE EVENTEMITTER ERRORS</em>. Errors are special events
in node, and if there&#39;s no listener for it, node&#39;ll just print a stack trace and
exit. So always always always be aware, and do something like <code>.on(&#39;error&#39;, fn)</code>
to make sure you&#39;re handling errors the way you <strong>want</strong> to handle them, rather
than just letting shit crash and die.</p>

<p>Gulp core&#39;s api is THIS SIMPLE. Check this out.</p>
<pre class="hljs"><code>.<span class="hljs-function"><span class="hljs-title">src</span><span class="hljs-params">(globs [, options])</span></span>   <span class="hljs-comment">// takes glob, returns stream in</span>

.<span class="hljs-function"><span class="hljs-title">watch</span><span class="hljs-params">(glob [, opts], cb)</span></span> <span class="hljs-comment">// watches fs</span></code></pre><p>That&#39;s IT. The entire codebase is actually readable in a relatively short amount
of time. Fuckin&#39; beautiful.</p>
<p>Clearly that doesn&#39;t include <code>.pipe()</code>, but pipe isn&#39;t exactly an api thing I
think. It&#39;s a pipe. That&#39;d be like saying &#39;oh yeah, you need to learn |, that&#39;s
a really important thing&#39; or whatever. Sure, it&#39;s the most vital and fundamental
thing about *n*x, but it&#39;s not a thing you learn, I guess.</p>
<p>(note : pipe is from node, not gulp-specific)</p>
<hr>
<p>Regarding ES6 <code>let</code> and <code>const</code>: <code>let</code> would be mutable. <code>const</code> is basically
exactly what it sounds like.</p>
<p>(note : not exactly)</p>
<hr>
<p>React things:</p>
<p><code>componentWillMount()</code> is triggered <em>once</em>, before any rendering.</p>
<p><code>componentDidMount()</code> is triggered <em>after</em> initial rendering. Access to DOM, here!</p>
<p><code>componentWillReceiveProps(object nextProps)</code> triggers after component receives new props.</p>
<p><code>shouldComponentUpdate(object nextProps, object nextState)</code> optimize rendering, return false if no need to update.</p>
<p><code>componentWillUpdate(same as above, there ^^ )</code> triggered after shouldEtc,etc..., and before <code>render()</code>.</p>
<p><code>compnentDidUpdate()</code> after rendering. Modify the DOM here.</p>
<p><code>componentWillUnmount()</code> just before component unmounted from DOM--do cleanup here.</p>
<p><code>displayName</code> good for debug especially. ES6 classes, derived from class name.</p>
<p><code>getInitialState()</code> equivalent of constructor in classes.</p>
<p><code>getDefaultProps()</code> same, bro.</p>
<p><code>mixins</code> array</p>
<p><code>statics</code> properties and methods for component</p>
<hr>
<p>Webpack: <code>preLoaders</code> gets executed before <code>loaders</code>, regardless of order; this
still goes in under <code>module:{}</code>.  <code>jshint-loader</code> works in here! That&#39;ll just
look for your standard <code>.jshintrc</code>.</p>
<p>Eslint would be better for React, especially because of <code>eslint-plugin-react</code>.
Eslint also has autofixing (--fix) for some stuff.</p>
<p>With eslint we&#39;d just include that as an npm script, eg <code>npm run lint</code> with
<code>&quot;lint&quot;: &quot;eslint . --ext .js --ext .jsx --fix&quot;</code>.</p>
<p>Eslint also follows an <code>.eslintignore</code>, and an <code>.eslintrc</code>. Rules have
<em>severity</em>: 0 for disabled, 1 for warning, 2 for error. Some rules take an
<em>array</em> instead, like <code>&quot;quotes&quot;: [2, &quot;single&quot;]</code>.</p>
<p>When there&#39;s a lint error with Eslint, npm will give you an <code>ELIFECYCLE</code> error.
To hide that, we could do <code>npm run lint --silent</code>; alternatively, the same npm
script above could have <code>|| true</code> appended, but if we invoke that from somewhere
else, it&#39;ll pass even when there are failures.</p>
<p><code>jscs</code>, with <code>jscs-loader</code>, follows <code>.jscsrc</code>.</p>
<p>And, lastly, there&#39;s always EditorConfig and the <code>.editorconfig</code> file.</p>
<hr>
<p>Flux: really just an architecture pattern that means it has a <em>unidirectional
data flow</em>. Like, seriously, that&#39;s all. Here&#39;s an example diagram: <code>Actions -&gt;
Data Stores -&gt; Components (Views)</code>. That&#39;s <em>it</em>. All Flux really is is a way of
<em>thinking</em> about things. That&#39;s why there are libraries that <em>implement</em> Flux
patterns, like Alt.</p>
<p>Another example diagram:</p>
<pre class="hljs"><code>  Stores &lt;- - <span class="hljs-string">\</span>

<p>Some React Vocab:</p>
<p>As of some...time, <em>all</em> React custom components <em>must</em> be Uppercase, like This,
to differentiate from standard xml/html. See <a href="https://gist.github.com/sebmarkbage/f1f4ba40816e7d7848ad">this
gist</a> for more info on
that.</p>
<p>There are five main types in React (and that&#39;s a horrible word to use, can we
think of something better? Kinds of elements? Things? Idk...).</p>
<p>React Elements are the primary... thing. A <code>ReactElement</code> has four properties:
type, props, key, ref. No methods, nothing on prototype. Created like <code>var foo =
React.createElement(&#39;div&#39;).</code> You pass these to <code>React.render</code>, with a DOM element
(HTML or SVG), like <code>React.render(foo, document.body)</code>. To add properties to it,
pass a properties object as the second argument. Children to the third. (Note
that if using JSX, that&#39;s a bit less verbose.</p>
<p><code>ReactElement</code>-<em>factory</em> is a function that generates <code>ReactElement</code> with
specific <code>type</code> property. <code>function createFactory(type){return
React.createElement.bind(null, type)}</code>; <code>var div = React.createFactory(&#39;div&#39;);
var foo = div({className: &#39;my-div&#39;}); React.render(foo, document.body)</code>. Common
HTML tags have built-in factories in React (like <code>var quux = React.DOM.ul</code> or
<code>var bar = React.DOM.li</code>). But, again, JSX negates the need for factories.</p>
<p><code>ReactNode</code> could be <code>ReactElement</code>, string, number, or array of ReactNodes
(<code>ReactFragment</code>). This is a property of other <code>ReactElement</code>s used to represent
children. Kind of basically create a tree of REs.</p>
<p><code>ReactComponent</code> would be where the real meat of React can be found. Here we can
create whatsits in React, and then sort of encapsulate them with their own
little embedded <em>state</em>. And remember, in React, everything is state. And
everything is a really ugly bit of PHP that wants to be Javascript. So, <code>var
thingy = React.createElement(SomeComponent)</code> or <code>var thingy = &lt;Some Component

<p>A transpiler is a compiler. It takes code that can&#39;t be run on whatever engine
it&#39;s targetting, and compiles it so it works. The only actual difference is that
when funky-code-X is compiled into normal-code-Y, it stays at around the same
level of abstraction. So, turning JSX or ES6 into ES5 doesn&#39;t really make a vast
difference in terms of performance, and it&#39;s not like Javascript is a low-level
language that we&#39;re compiling to, using Babel--we&#39;re just basically
cross-piling. Hence the &#39;trans&#39; prefix.</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Barbara:</p>
<ul>
<li>Networking events matter.</li>
<li>Barbara from DM2 ended up as the only actual webdev at her company</li>
<li>This kinda means she&#39;s got to be everything from junior dev to PM</li>
<li>Definitely don&#39;t be self-deprecating about stuff.</li>
<li>Express interest outright in companies/their products.</li>
<li>Yeah, sure, don&#39;t talk yourself <em>up</em> too much, but seriously, communicate
well about what you&#39;ve actually managed to do, because they want to know.</li>
<li>Know why it is that a company makes the choices it does. Barbara&#39;s
example: knowing why it was the company she works for uses Angular.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>Mark:</p>
<ul>
<li>Having past projects to talk about <em>really</em> helps. Obviously. Duh.</li>
<li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Situation,_Task,_Action,_Result">STAR</a> is a thing,
and maybe I should actually know what that is, I guess?</li>
<li>This is basically a totally disheartening little talk. What?</li>
<li>They asked him to rewrite his whole project in Scala. I&#39;m confused about what
this guy is actually even talking about. What is this?</li>
<li>His experience is basically one of being put through hell to get in with
some SAAS analytics-analytics company (yes, that&#39;s correct, his company
analyses analytics).</li>
<li>Actual takeaways: go to meetups, network with people, and talk about <em>why</em>
you actually want to be doing this.</li>
<li>Trying out actual interviews (like, with companies where it may or may not
ever happen, but basically you&#39;re not really counting on that working out
anyway) can be a lot more helpful than just going over responses on your own
or in an absolutely-no-pressure kind of situation.</li>
<li>Oh, wait, okay. As depressing as his little bit was, the actual point of it
is this: jump through the hoops, because it&#39;ll probably be worth it. Maybe
the company will pay you for your work on the project (I mean, that&#39;s kinda
becoming normal now, anyway). Maybe they won&#39;t -- and if they don&#39;t, use that
project or whatever on your portfolio.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>Dallin:</p>
<ul>
<li>He likes whatever it is that he does now, I guess.</li>
<li>He has &#39;come to realise more, the many fallacies in his personality.&#39;<ul>
<li>Yay?</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>I don&#39;t know that he has any actual advice. Besides, basically, just kinda
don&#39;t be like him, because he&#39;s more about learning from mistakes than just,
like, maybe, not trying to make as many.</li>
<li>He said a lot of other things but I was too busy being really annoyed with
the damned profiles.devmounta.in project to take any other notes.<ul>
<li>Seriously, it wouldn&#39;t kill people to check pull requests before making
huge commits. I give up.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Dallin learned Ruby in a week between getting hired and actually starting work.
That&#39;s pretty cool. He works mostly in Rails, and I know he does Coffeescript,
so chances are he learned that on the job (knowing Ruby definitely would&#39;ve
helped with that).</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>Jeff:</p>
<ul>
<li>Don&#39;t make portfolio pieces that aren&#39;t accessible.<ul>
<li>Example: his Instagram analytics site.</li>
<li>If this isn&#39;t possible, do a video demo of that project.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="angular">ANGULAR</h2>
<p>so, <code>expressions</code>, basically that&#39;s why we&#39;re gonna be mashing those braces
constantly. it&#39;s kind of like inline scripts, but minus the script tags?</p>
<p><code>directives</code> are the powerful bit. jqueryish dom extension? apparently something
we&#39;ll use a lot is <code>ngRepeat</code>, which, if it means writing less html, is a-ok
with me.</p>
<pre class="hljs"><code><span class="xml"><span class="hljs-tag">&lt;<span class="hljs-title">div</span>&gt;</span>
  <span class="hljs-tag">&lt;<span class="hljs-title">div</span> <span class="hljs-attribute">data-ng-repeat</span>=<span class="hljs-value">&quot;user in users&quot;</span>&gt;</span>
  <span class="hljs-tag">&lt;<span class="hljs-title">h4</span>&gt;</span></span><span class="hljs-expression">{{<span class="hljs-variable">user.name</span>}}</span><span class="xml"><span class="hljs-tag">&lt;/<span class="hljs-title">h4</span>&gt;</span>

  <span class="hljs-tag">&lt;/<span class="hljs-title">div</span>&gt;</span>
<span class="hljs-tag">&lt;/<span class="hljs-title">div</span>&gt;</span></span></code></pre><p>so it&#39;s like how python folks write python everything, including html; we&#39;re
writing javascriptish markup! it makes sense in those terms. that snippet there
just created that same div for each user in users; say we have several user
objects, it&#39;ll just go right ahead and repeat that markup per user.</p>
<p><code>ngShow</code> determines if an element should be shown or not, based on a boolean.</p>
<pre class="hljs"><code><span class="xml"><span class="hljs-tag">&lt;<span class="hljs-title">div</span> <span class="hljs-attribute">data-ng-repeat</span>=<span class="hljs-value">&quot;pizza in boxes&quot;</span> <span class="hljs-attribute">data-ng-show</span>=<span class="hljs-value">&quot;pizza.topping == &#39;peppers&#39;&quot;</span>&gt;</span>

<p><code>ngSwitch</code> OHH THIS IS USEFUL. we could&#39;ve used this last week.</p>

<p>directives straight up from angular are all named <code>ngSomethingStuff</code>; they&#39;re
used like &quot;ng-something-stuff&quot; (or &quot;data-ng-something-stuff&quot;) in view. they can
also be comments (?), dom elements, or CSS classes (oh hai jquery what up).</p>
<p>one could use &#39;operations&#39; within those little handlebars up there (i believe
we&#39;re calling those <code>expressions</code>, and <code>operations</code> would be our word for
executable snippets, basically?). so <code>{{pizzza.beInMe()}}</code> is totally valid.</p>
<p><code>ngModel</code> to create two-way data-binding.</p>
<p>aaaaand i do believe this example just literally piped a username to uppercase.
OKAY. <code>{{name | uppercase}}</code> that is, apparently, called a <code>filter</code>, though in
the interest of correctness (and also just to irk ryan :P) i&#39;ll keep calling
them pipes, thank you very much.</p>
<p>hmm. it would seem the guy who wrote this intro to angular is either getting
paid by google, or currently sitting on someone&#39;s dick there... some of the
worship is just a wee bit too cloying for real life.</p>
<p><code>ngApp</code> is the directive to include a partial (to bind an application, in the
parlance). <code>ngView</code> to actually use it.</p>
<p><code>.config</code> does (whodathunkit) configuration, basically by d i (?). you <em>could</em>
pass a function with parameters named after what you&#39;re sourcing that way, but
it&#39;s not good practice (actually, i hadn&#39;t thought about that before... what
happens to variables by the time they&#39;ve been through minification, base62, and
gzip? ⊙▃⊙). instead, you should use an array with the names of the elements that
should get all shot up in your page, because, y&#39;know, ain&#39;t no one messing with
your actual data.</p>
<p><code>routes</code> are a big deal, from what i hear. here&#39;s a simple one from this guy&#39;s
blog post:</p>
<pre class="hljs"><code>angularStuff.config([<span class="hljs-string">&#39;$routeProvider&#39;</span>, <span class="hljs-keyword">function</span>(<span class="hljs-variable">$routeProvider</span>) {
  <span class="hljs-variable">$routeProvider</span>.when(<span class="hljs-string">&#39;/objects&#39;</span>, {
        templateURI : <span class="hljs-string">&#39;view/objects.html&#39;</span>
    , controller  : <span class="hljs-string">&#39;ObjCtrl&#39;</span>
    }).otherwise({templateURI : <span class="hljs-string">&#39;view/NOPE.html&#39;</span>})
}])</code></pre><p>please forgive me, but i need to take a minute to say some things that should be
obvious.</p>
<p>yes, this way of working with partials and configs is pretty sweet, but let&#39;s be
honest, here, and very straightforward: partials and templating systems and
whatnot exist solely for the purpose of making things <em>easier</em> on the people
doing the programming. somehow i feel like going with even more nested
punctuation is more of an exercise in concrete poetry than a highly advanced and
developed javascript framework. ugh.</p>
<p><code>.controller</code> is, like, what you use for controllers. <code>$scope</code> links your
controllers and their bound views. (?) (or binded, if you&#39;re this fellow.)</p>
<pre class="hljs"><code>angularThang.controller(<span class="hljs-string">&#39;BTCtrl&#39;</span>, [<span class="hljs-string">&#39;$scope&#39;</span>, <span class="hljs-keyword">function</span> (<span class="hljs-variable">$scope</span>) {
  <span class="hljs-variable">$scope</span>.objects = [{
    key  : <span class="hljs-string">&#39;value&#39;</span>
  , next : <span class="hljs-string">&#39;another&#39;</span>
  },{
    key  : <span class="hljs-string">&#39;let\&#39;</span>s do it again<span class="hljs-string">&#39;
  , next : &#39;</span>okay, now we\<span class="hljs-string">&#39;re done&#39;</span>
  }]
}])</code></pre><p><code>$watch</code> calls a listener for a controller on an attribute of its scope (oh boy,
pronouns, this is fun). <code>$broadcast</code> will trigger an event on a scope, which&#39;ll
be transmitted to that scope, and <em>all</em> of its children. to trigger a global
even, you&#39;d use <code>$rootScope</code>. without copying down every example from this
rather crudely typed out blog post, we&#39;re basically using
<code>$scope.$watch(stuff)</code>, <code>$scope.$broadcast</code>, <code>$scope.$on</code> etc. so, y&#39;know. extra
<code>$$$$$$$$</code> for everyone.</p>
<p>obviously <code>services</code> are gonna be my favourite toy here. there&#39;s an <code>$http</code>
builtin! (i think... as mentioned, this blogger is probably better at writing
code that writing words, so... i don&#39;t really know). so you can inject them (oh
geez, really? we&#39;re going with &#39;inject&#39; here? we couldn&#39;t&#39;ve said &#39;require&#39; or
&#39;load&#39; or some other generic and often used term that could maybe be <em>slightly</em>
less confusing in this context?) into your controllers and whatnots and
fiddlybits, straight up. same goes for custom
services/external/third-party/whatever, i suppose. basically you&#39;ve just got to
have some sort of usable api there for other services &amp; fiddlywhatnots to
access.</p>
<p><code>$http</code> is a thin wrapper on XHR; <code>$resource</code> is higher level (though without
any examples of how, all i have to go on is that you can call POST something
like &#39;save&#39; and get something like &#39;GIMME DAT&#39; or whatever... so... what?). and
i think <code>$resource</code> is <em>not</em> a builtin, because you&#39;d need to have a dependency
on <code>ngResource</code> to use it. and here he says we&#39;ve got <code>$httpBackend</code> built in to
test without a web server, but he doesn&#39;t mention if that&#39;s actually a builtin
or a core module that would need to be required, nor does he mention whether or
not it runs a webserver itself or just sends out a fake packet, internally, or
whatever.</p>
<hr>
<p>so, jeremy&#39;s super-boiled-down 10-second run-through of the MVC pattern
definitely clarified the actual role of the controller. i mean, i kind of
understood that it&#39;s basically binding models and views, but never really
understood it as the actual middleman until just now. that is awfully sensible.</p>
<p>implied, but not stated explicitly: react is less of a bottleneck as a view than
angular is.</p>
<p>something to keep in mind: <code>$scope</code> is straight up two-way binding, not sortof
or sometimes as was implied in the article.</p>
<p>oh, <code>directive</code> is basically just silly slang for attributes.</p>
<p>mismatched bits and bobs? not with angular, it&#39;ll just boink up some fresh new
dom nodes for your loose-ends</p>
<p>$timeout basically same syntax as setTimeout, except</p>
<pre class="hljs"><code><span class="hljs-variable">$timeout</span>(<span class="hljs-keyword">function</span>(){
  <span class="hljs-variable">$scope</span>.thing = <span class="hljs-string">&#39;that&#39;</span>
}, <span class="hljs-number">10000</span>)</code></pre><p>EVEYTHING that goes IN the html that angular will use is INSIDE of
ng-controller, attached to its $scope</p>
<p>so for the  HTML to even give a crap about what&#39;s going on in your javascript,
it&#39;s gotta be in a $scope. everything that you want angular to actually act on
had better be {{}} in the html and $scope in your js</p>
<p>as jeremy explained it, your js as it sits in your files is ALSO basically kind
of a starting point, because (and see 1.md for more notes on triggering events),
what angular does is (he said scan for but i understood it as wait for triggers
from) basically an excuse to go changing things. so your objects, variables,
whatever are OH MY GOD NOW I KNOW WHAT IMMUTABLE JAVASCRIPT IS A BIG DEAL OKAY
(no, not because of angular, but because it just hit me how how loose EVERYTHING
can really be in javascript... wow, no wonder js get so much hate. it probably
deserves it.)</p>
<p>ng-repeat makes a miniature scope for the foo part of <code>ng-repeat=&quot;foo in bar&quot;</code>
-- underneath, i suppose. that&#39;s super slick.</p>
<pre class="hljs"><code>&lt;input ng-model=<span class="hljs-string">&quot;someFilter&quot;</span>&gt; <span class="hljs-comment">// filter is a keyword to angular, it knows to look for a filter as defined by itself</span>
&lt;<span class="hljs-keyword">div</span> ng-repeat=<span class="hljs-string">&quot;some in such | filter: someFilter&quot;</span>&gt;
{{some.stuff}} {{some.things}} <span class="hljs-comment">// okay, and i suppose, it looks like filter is just a builtin that does just that one</span>
{{some.stuff}} {{some.things}} <span class="hljs-comment">// exact thing... it only shows the thing that you&#39;re inputting/providing as a filter</span>
{{some.stuff}} {{some.things}} <span class="hljs-comment">// BUT that does not necessarily have to mean actual filtered string fragments.</span>
{{some.stuff}} {{some.things}} <span class="hljs-comment">// THIS MAKES LIFE EASY.</span>
&lt;/<span class="hljs-keyword">div</span>&gt;
&lt;<span class="hljs-keyword">div</span> ng-repeat=<span class="hljs-string">&quot;some in such | filter: { name: someFilter location { name: locationNameFilter } }&quot;</span>&gt;
<span class="hljs-comment">// so basically we&#39;re interactively filtering here, but also filtering by the type of whatchamacallits,</span>

really, basically, we&#39;re just going over use-cases and examples now. which is totally fine,
of course.</p>
<p>note that when we go ahead and send a buncha chained promises, we&#39;re gonna get stuff back
however it comes back, not in the order we started things. we&#39;d want to sort things after,
if needed, not (obviously) within promises, because that would make all of that redundant;
we&#39;d basically be using promises to run some synchronous javascript, at that point.
dumb.</p>

<p>a whole bunch of basically totally disorganised notes from when i was working
on my &#39;personal project&#39; at devmountain.</p>
<p>this was meant to be a sort of ghost/medium for the desktop -- a blogging platform
for people who actually cared about writing. turns out no one really wants that.
also it turns out <a href="https://github.com/TryGhost/Ghost-Desktop">ghost was working on a desktop application</a>
cool.</p>
<p>requirements for this: make a mean stack app, basically.</p>
<p>anyway <a href="https://github.com/zacanger/ayuba">this is the remains of that poor app i built</a>
and more importantly here&#39;s the mess of notes i took while doing stuff with that.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="planner">Planner</h2>
<p>At DevMountain, for projects, you&#39;re encouraged (required, really) to use a planning
paper, which is basically a big sheet of paper divided up into sections that represent
pieces of a standard MEAN-stack app, and a sort of roadmap-to-an-end-product thing along
the bottom.</p>
<p>I was actually out sick the day those got handed out for the personal projects, but NBD,
there was a PDF version floating around so I threw a little app up using that (converted to
PNG and colour-inverted) using a little bit of PHP and jQuery to make a kind of sticky-notes
bulletin-board kind of thingy to serve the same purpose. One benefit of this is that I was
able to easily just save all my notes out (they were all just in a big text file anyway, on
my server). Note: I&#39;d initially planned on using my earlier app from my &#39;no-server&#39; project
(something we do at DevMountain early on, just an Angular app that can actually use a server
so long as it&#39;s a BaaS and not one we&#39;ve spent time doing, because we don&#39;t actually know how
to do that at that point) called <a href="https://github.com/zacanger/markvi">markvi</a>.</p>
<p>Anyway, these are the contents from my planning thing.</p>
<h3 id="ideas-and-users">Ideas and Users</h3>
<p>concept: a blogging platform <em>for writers, and readers</em>, based not around the
ADHD social media style of content-creation and likes and shares that&#39;s taken
over the popular idea of the blog, but instead around long-form writing; essays,
meaningful stories, and such. the target audience here is the moderately
technically savvy pseudo-bohemian; 25-50, used to smoke cloves, probably hangs
out in coffee shops too much.</p>
<h3 id="features">Features</h3>
<ul>
<li>mvp: oh wait, that&#39;s already done. well, except for getting it to work in the
desktop client, which is the entire idea here.</li>
<li>the rest:<ul>
<li>a clean, simple &#39;feed&#39; (a la jekyll archive pages), filterable by tag and possibly date.</li>
<li>comments.</li>
<li>import/export without relying on the browser (to markdown and html).</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="views">Views</h3>
<ol>
<li>the existing markdown editor (however, likely revamped to move away from
plain old codemirror, and to include a basic rte-style toolbar).</li>
<li>the rendered panel, alone (the reading view; same on one&#39;s own posts as
someone else&#39;s).</li>
<li>the &#39;social&#39; view: a feed, no &#39;content-based&#39; sorting, just purely ordered
chronologically, and filterable by tag (and POSSIBLY date range).</li>
<li>-ish?: comments. they&#39;ll be isolated (data-wise), so it may be smarter to
load them in dynamically (see: discourse [not discuz, they&#39;re ruby], but don&#39;t
do that stupid thing where half the page disappears, that&#39;s some annoying-ass
bullshit).</li>
<li>settings. VERY simple. name, email, password, export (if possible) to an
archive file, delete account.</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="controllers">Controllers</h3>
<ul>
<li>browser, main, and nav (see existing codebase)</li>
<li>not controllers, but...</li>
<li>services: files (existing)</li>
<li>filters: filename and cut (existing)<ul>
<li>by tag (feed view)</li>
<li>(also possibly by date -- narrowing -- feed view)</li>

<p>this would be relatively easy to throw up in a web browser. blogging platforms
are a dime a dozen, especially ones built on node. the idea here isn&#39;t to make
another tumblr, but to bring actual writing back to the web. sort of like
medium, but without all the twitter. a key part of that is having it NOT be in a
browser. right now the goal is to put all this in an electron shell, but i&#39;m not
going to focus super hardcore on that right this moment. if i can get everything
else in place and rock-solid first, then i&#39;ll stuff it all in electron. if not,
then i&#39;ll just write up a manifest file and call it a chrome app. either way,
fuck y&#39;all, it&#39;s already got nigh on a thousand installs....</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="the-presentation-speech">The Presentation Speech</h2>
<p>This is what I&#39;d planned to say when presenting my app. I think instead
I just kind of mumbled a little bit about how neat CodeMirror is and how
annoying it was to struggle with the <code>&#39;node-integration&#39;</code> issue with
Electron.</p>
<h3 id="markdown">Markdown</h3>
<p>…is a lightweight markup language which makes writing for the web a much quicker
and easier process than if using a rich text editor (like Word), which wouldn&#39;t
translate to HTML anyway, or writing HTML manually. Intead of <code>&lt;em&gt;</code> or
<code>&lt;strong&gt;</code>, in Markdown you&#39;d use a <code>_</code> or <code>*</code>, or <code>__</code> or <code>**</code>. Readme files on
Github are usually written in an implementation of Markdown called Github
Flavoured Markdown, which shows just how popular the format has grown. Stack
Overflow, the Discourse comment system, and various blog systems including
Ghost, Wordpress, Tumblr all use Markdown, if not by default than as an option.</p>
<p>vi is possibly the most influential editor of, like, ever. it was written in
1976, and either vi or one of its descendants (usually vim, which stands for &#39;vi
improved&#39;) has been on almost every unix-based system since then, including
every computer in this building (except the microsoft machines -- and even on
those, if you have git-bash or something similar). vim&#39;s power comes from how
easily and quickly it can manipulate large chunks of text. For example, typing
in <code>d5k</code> will delete five lines upwards, and<code>497G</code> jumps to line 497.</p>
<p>So, putting these things together makes for a really great tool for writing. Not
necessarily writing Tweets or Facebook posts, but writing longer texts, like
articles or essays. That&#39;s the purpose of this app. It&#39;s not a social blog. It&#39;s
kind of like Medium minus Twitter, Tumblr minus reblogging, or LiveJournal
minus… teenagers.</p>
<p>Since the editor component itself is based around CodeMirror, it&#39;s very
extensible, which is exciting because it leaves so much open for future
development. For example, if we wanted to make this a Javascript editor instead,
we could just change a few lines and now we have the right syntax highlighting,
automatic indentation, et cetera.</p>
<p>Oh, and, so, this is all a desktop app. It runs perfectly fine in a browser, but
from the beginning it was really meant to be a desktop tool; browsers are
distracting, this not so much.</p>
<p>Aaaand here&#39;s the code.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="misc-notes">misc notes</h2>
<p>All this stuff was just thrown in another file.
It&#39;s mostly to do with <a href="https://electron.atom.io">Electron</a>, I think.</p>
<p>check <a href="https://github.com/atom/electron/blob/master/docs%2Fapi%2Fbrowser-window.md">https://github.com/atom/electron/blob/master/docs%2Fapi%2Fbrowser-window.md</a>
before trying to get any other browser-shit going on--we&#39;ll want to move things
into their own windows, i feel; chromeless might be a good idea, at least for
the editor view</p>
<pre class="hljs"><code>const BrowserWindow = <span class="hljs-function"><span class="hljs-title">require</span><span class="hljs-params">(<span class="hljs-string">&#39;electron&#39;</span>)</span></span><span class="hljs-class">.BrowserWindow</span>
let win = new <span class="hljs-function"><span class="hljs-title">BrowserWindow</span><span class="hljs-params">({width : <span class="hljs-number">1900</span>, height : <span class="hljs-number">1600</span>, frame : false})</span></span></code></pre><p>so basically it&#39;s just a new browser window, frame as false, but we want to
probably lock the px to whatever screen we&#39;re working with, if CSS continues to
fail miserably.</p>
<p>-- note: check how atom manages to not fuck that up. except those bits where
they do.</p>
<p>frameless = non-draggable (even with alt?). specify <code>-webkit-app-region: drag</code>
in css. or, say, <code>body { -webkit-app-region: drag }</code> for all of that. this
necessitates <code>button { -webkit-app-region: no-drag }</code> (same for non-button
clickables, one assumes).</p>

just making our own little bits. it makes sense. if it works as a template file, or as just regular html,
it&#39;ll work as a custom directive. just more reusable as a directive.</p>
<p>we could have a directive with a TYPE. imagine a function that returns a customer with an attribute that&#39;s
.type... so we&#39;d have a directive called myCustomer, type=&quot;name&quot;, then another, type=&quot;smoking habits&quot;.
paramaters here are always (element, attribute).</p>
<p>Restrict as a property: E means element (so you&#39;d do <myDirective> instead of <div myDirective>
A is attribute, so it&#39;d be <div myDirective>
can do BOTH so it&#39;d work for either. (restrict: EA)
C is for class, but let&#39;s not do that! That seems like a really not okay and very bad idea.
This is basically for semantic enforcement. Element would be good for a custom block, eg</p>
<p><myDirective>a whole bunch of shit just about this one</myDirective></p>
<p><mySECONDdirective>another whole bunch</mySECONDdirective> etc
A would be good for tacking things onto elements that would likely be there anyway, it seems.
If you need to take in parameters, A would be better.</p>
<p>custom filters like this!</p>
<pre class="hljs"><code>&lt;input model=<span class="hljs-string">&quot;whatcha&quot;</span>&gt;
&lt;span custom=<span class="hljs-string">&quot;format&quot;</span>&gt;
<span class="hljs-keyword">function</span> link(scope, <span class="hljs-literal">element</span>, attributes){
var whatever
stuffings
}
<span class="hljs-keyword">return</span> { link: link; }

format=value;
updateTime();
});</code></pre><p>link ALWAYS takes in at leaste those three, and alkways in that order!</p>
<p>inside a directive, feel free to do some jquery-lite.
if you want to use, say, d3, or three.js, you can go ahead and inject that into angular
and use it. (we&#39;re talking about other DOM manupilation, not utilities like lodash).</p>
<p>inside a link whatever, that scp refers to its parent&#39;s scope, it shares parent&#39;s scope
by default. eg if custom up there is directly below mainCtrl, scp means mainCtrl&#39;s $scope.</p>
<p>underneath .directive, the scope: { stuff } actually means, like, scope INSTRUCTIONS or
somesuch.</p>
<p>SCOPE</p>
<pre class="hljs"><code><span class="hljs-tag">scope</span>: {
<span class="hljs-attribute">string</span>: <span class="hljs-string">&#39;@&#39;</span>,
<span class="hljs-attribute">link</span>: <span class="hljs-string">&#39;=&#39;</span>,
<span class="hljs-attribute">func</span>: <span class="hljs-string">&#39;&amp;&#39;</span>
}</code></pre><p>The properties on the scope object represent the attributes on the directive in the html. Our example scope object here would look something like this in the html.
<code>&lt;example-directive string=&quot;a string&quot; link=&quot;user&quot; func=&quot;updateUser()&quot;&gt;&lt;/example-directive&gt;</code>
The hard part here is the <code>@</code>, <code>=</code>, and <code>&amp;</code>. They each have very important and distinct meanings.</p>
<ul>
<li><code>@</code> says take in my attribute value as a string.</li>
<li><code>=</code> says take in my attribute value as a two-way bound variable from the parent scope.</li>
<li><p><code>&amp;</code> says take in my attribute value as a reference to a function on the parent scope.</p>
</li>
<li><p>(from another notes snippet):</p>
<ul>
<li><code>@</code> : string/text (one-way)</li>
<li><code>=</code> : two-way</li>
<li><code>&amp;</code> : binds parent scope&#39;s methods into directive&#39;s scope</li>
<li><code>&lt;</code> : one-way (outer-to-inner)</li>

<li><code>varTwo = var++</code> would mean <code>varTwo = var</code>, <code>var=var+1</code>, etc. keep in mind.</li>
<li>and, <code>varTwo = ++var</code> is the same as <code>++var,</code> <code>varTwo = var</code></li>
<li>(so, if <code>var</code> is originally one, both <code>varTwo</code> and <code>var</code> are now equal to two).</li>
<li>In other words, <code>++var</code> says &#39;increment this <code>var</code>; the value of the expression is the final value,&#39;
while <code>var++</code> would mean &#39;remember var? go ahead and increment it, but the value of the expression
is the original value of <code>var</code>.&#39; <code>var++</code> and <code>++var</code> are the same thing, but when used in an expression,
they&#39;ll return differently.</li>

<p>Functions are first-class objects. This means that <code>var foo = 2</code> and <code>var bar = function(quux, baz){return quux + baz}</code>
are equally valid. This isn&#39;t exactly special, but it means that (importantly) functions can be passed as arguments.
<code>var fooBar = function(fn, quux, baz){return fn(quux, baz)}</code> is still good, as is the following:</p>

function(){return things}}</code>. Closures, for example, always return the same thing, as in <code>var what = stuff(function(){})

<p>A closure&#39;s inner function has access to its parent&#39;s scope <em>even after the parent function has been returned</em>.

<h2 id="angular">angular</h2>
<p>Don&#39;t design a page, then manuipulate the DOM (as you would in jQuery). Here, we&#39;re no longer building websites that we
make expressive and add to with Javascript... we&#39;re building applications in the browser, and thinking about
<em>architecting</em> an app, rather than building a website.</p>
<p>Related to that, don&#39;t try to build out your site in HTML, CSS, and Javascript (or jQuery, or whatever), and use Angular
for models and controllers. Angular doesn&#39;t like that. Angular gets mad. If you&#39;re committing to using Angular, you&#39;re
committing to learning that DSL, and using it. Angular wasn&#39;t built by Javascript people to program in Javascript. It
was designed by Java people for designers to be able to sketch out concepts in the browser.</p>
<p>The <em>view</em> is the official &#39;record&#39; in Angular. So you never actually change the DOM, except in directives, which are
applied in the view.</p>
<p>Angular&#39;s two-way data binding is actually probably it&#39;s strongest feature, at least for small apps. Using jQuery, we
might do something like the following to update content based on events:</p>
<pre class="hljs"><code><span class="hljs-variable">$.</span>ajax({
  url <span class="hljs-symbol">:</span> <span class="hljs-string">&#39;/thing.json&#39;</span>
, success (data, status) {
    <span class="hljs-variable">$(</span><span class="hljs-string">&#39;ul#log&#39;</span>).append(<span class="hljs-string">&#39;&lt;li&gt;data is here!&lt;/li&gt;&#39;</span>)
  }
})</code></pre><p>(where in the HTML we might have <code>&lt;ul id=&quot;log&quot;&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;</code>). In Angular, we&#39;d do:</p>
<pre class="hljs"><code><span class="hljs-variable">$http</span>(<span class="hljs-string">&#39;/thing.json&#39;</span>).<span class="hljs-keyword">then</span>(response =&gt; {
  <span class="hljs-variable">$scope</span>.log.push({msg : <span class="hljs-string">&#39;data is here!&#39;</span>})
})</code></pre><p>for a view that looks like <code>&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li ng-repeat&quot;thing in log&quot;&gt;{{thing.msg}}&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;</code>.</p>
<p>We could also just have, in our view, something like <code>&lt;input ng-model=&quot;thing.msg&quot;&gt;</code>, and there&#39;s our two-way data
binding.</p>
<p>Angular&#39;s separation of concerns is very much an MVC-ish architecture. You have a view, a model (representing data), a
service layer (reusable tasks), directives for DOM manipulation, and controllers to just stick it all together. We also
have DI in Angular, which is not at all new, but was a little unusual in client-side code before Angular really took
off. Essentially this just means we&#39;re exporting components, and then importing them in some other bit of code.</p>
<p>Something to keep in mind with Angular is that you&#39;re essentially compiling your Angular in the browser, into something
your browser&#39;s Javascript rendering engine can handle. This is the big reason Angular can have performance problems.
Angular is esssentialy <em>template driven</em> (just another way of saying that it&#39;s all about the view, as above). In
traditional sites, we&#39;re using unobtrusive Javascript; that is, we build a site, use semantic HTML, style things in a
stylesheet linked into the header, throw all our scripts in a file linked in the footer, and the page still works. In an
Angular app, you&#39;re fucked if you don&#39;t want/use/have JS, because your entire <code>index.html</code> might only consist of opening
and closing tags, and a couple of links to scripts/styles. Everything is written in Angular, which means you literally
cannot use your thing as a website anymore, because it is not (one clear indicator of this is just how badly hash
routing fucks up a lot of things).</p>
<p>This really goes back to the &#39;Angular Way&#39; of doing things--Angular isn&#39;t a framework for programmers to program; it&#39;s
not a framework to make performant, navigable, friendly sites for users to use--it&#39;s a DSL for Java developers and
designers to be able to use and comprehend equally well. Angular treats your HTML as if it&#39;s code to be compiled. In
that way it deviates from a regular MVC--the view in Angular is actaully mixed into your logic, and usually has its own
logic mixed into <em>it</em>. Angular compiles all of that into standard languages that browsers can actually understand.</p>
<p>Angular has no real solution for itself. If SEO, accessibility, compatibility, maintainability, performance, comformity
(to actual standards), ease of use, best practices, and conventional wisdom are important, Angular&#39;s probably not the
best choice. If you need to sketch out an idea and none of those are really a big deal, it&#39;s not necessarily a bad
option.</p>
<p>In Angular, you <em>want</em> to use two-way binding (I mean, really, why else use Angular, anymore?). Rather than writing a
function to update a DOM node based on an event, we&#39;re binding an element in the template, using either an attribute or
the <code>{{}}</code> notation. So, <code>&lt;input ng-model=&quot;foo.bar&quot;&gt;</code>, and <code>{{&lt;p&gt;{{foo.bar}}&lt;/p&gt;}}</code>. Now, we&#39;re sending data from the
view, to the model (<code>$scope.foo.bar</code>), and then sending that to our view.</p>
<p>Services are essentially helper functions, sorta. They&#39;re an object that contains data and functions. They&#39;re always
singletons. Nuff said.</p>
<p>One really basic way to think about the difference between Angular and many other ways of writing Javascript
applications would be this little summary: &#39;Don&#39;t select... <em>direct.</em>&#39; What I mean is, unlike in jQuery, where you use a
selector to find the elements, and then do things to them, in Angular you write your code <em>in</em> your elements (as in
<code>&lt;button ng-click=&quot;stuff()&quot;&gt;</code>), or simply write your own elements, and plug them in.</p>
<p>Angular&#39;s super opinionated about things. If you want to use unobtrusive JS, don&#39;t use Angular. Angular&#39;s position is
that it&#39;s an HTML extension; it&#39;s template-driven, declarative, and compiled.</p>
