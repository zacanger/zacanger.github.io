things in incredibly slow/unproductive ways. i know everyone has their own
ways of being awesome, and most of those ways are much more awesome ways than
the ways in which i am okay at things, but still, there are better ways, and
most developers i&#39;ve seen just have <em>no</em> idea how much time they waste.</p>
<p>so here are just some tiny little tips. none of these are big news, none
are esoteric, none are risky, all require a little bit of work but make things
a lot faster in a very short period of time.</p>
<h2 id="bash-things">bash things</h2>
<p>you can use zsh, and that&#39;s a thing, and it doesn&#39;t suck, okay, but it pays
to be good at bash. bash is everywhere. it&#39;s the default shell on just about
every system. zsh gives you nice things, but you can get all the same nice
things in bash with just a tiny bit of work.</p>
<p>the number one most useful thing to do with bash is aliases, i think.
it&#39;s generally recommended that you use functions if you can, but there&#39;s
really no harm in using aliases. try these out, for example:</p>
<pre class="hljs"><code><span class="hljs-keyword">alias</span> <span class="hljs-title">ns</span>=<span class="hljs-comment">&#39;npm start&#39;</span>
<span class="hljs-keyword">alias</span> <span class="hljs-title">nt</span>=<span class="hljs-comment">&#39;npm test&#39;</span>
<span class="hljs-keyword">alias</span> <span class="hljs-title">nis</span>=<span class="hljs-comment">&#39;npm i -S&#39;</span>
<span class="hljs-keyword">alias</span> <span class="hljs-title">nid</span>=<span class="hljs-comment">&#39;npm i -D&#39;</span>
<span class="hljs-keyword">alias</span> <span class="hljs-title">bn</span>=<span class="hljs-comment">&#39;babel-node&#39;</span></code></pre><p>throw these at the bottom of your <code>~/.bashrc</code> (or <code>~/.bash_profile</code> on a mac).</p>
<h2 id="npm">npm</h2>
<p>for that matter, there&#39;s the aliases up there... npm has a bunch built-in.
for example, you never need to type out <code>npm install --save-dev</code>
-- just do <code>npm i -S</code>.</p>
<p>npm gives you a million things. just read the docs sometime. or the help screens.</p>
<h2 id="the-terminal">the terminal</h2>
<p>use readline stuff. ctrl-w, ctrl-a, ctrl-e, even just those, just use them. ctrl-arrow
(or option-arrow on mac) to get around between words. use these things.</p>
<p>set your prompt up to tell you nice stuff. i <em>highly</em> recommend using liquidprompt
(<code>apt-get install -y liquidprompt</code> or <code>brew install liquidprompt</code>), but you can
also do all these things manually (check
<a href="https://github.com/zacanger/z/blob/master/.bashrc#L127">my dotfiles</a> for examples).</p>
<p>pick a bookmarking system and stick with it. <a href="https://github.com/wting/autojump">there</a>
<a href="https://github.com/rupa/z">are</a> a <a href="https://github.com/shyiko/commacd">bunch</a> of them
out there (many many more, just search). or export aliases to move to places. or you
<a href="https://github.com/zacanger/z/blob/master/.bash_functions/g.sh">can</a>
<a href="https://github.com/zacanger/z/blob/master/.bash_functions/ga.sh">use</a>
<a href="https://github.com/zacanger/z/blob/master/.bash_functions/gt.sh">mine</a> if you&#39;d like.</p>
<h2 id="markdown">markdown</h2>
<p>if you don&#39;t use it, use it. if you still click around in microsoft word or google docs,
goddamn, take two minutes to learn the easiest and most popular plain-to-rich-text
lightweight-markup authoring format out there. it&#39;s the only way to write, really.</p>
<h2 id="your-editor">your editor</h2>
<p>i don&#39;t care what your editor is. i really don&#39;t. i know just enough about lisp
to not even hate emacs users. i do dislike VS Code, but mostly because of the
idiotic and transparent licensing scheme. and also because it&#39;s not a very
good editor. but the built-in debugger isn&#39;t bad (you can get all the same things
from other tools, but it is better than the ones that you can get for most other
editors for node).</p>
<p>whatever your editor is, take a week to learn it really well. in my case, finally
just spending some time getting <em>fluid</em> with vim has made a huge difference.
i no longer have any other editors installed (and i tried a lot of them! i loved
<a href="http://lighttable.com/">LightTable</a> and <a href="http://foicica.com/textadept/">Textadept</a>
especially, and also really liked atom (but it&#39;s <em>slow</em>); brackets was a waste of
my time, sublime was okay but nonfree and there&#39;s textadept so whatever, see above
for notes on VS code; actual IDEs i tent to avoid because they&#39;re just overwhelmingly
large and in the way all the time, to me). that doesn&#39;t mean vim&#39;s the <em>best</em> editor
(though it totally is), it just means it&#39;s the one i decided i wanted use, and it&#39;s
the absolute best tool that i have now because i&#39;m pretty quick with it.</p>
<p>even if you use vs code or brackets (i&#39;d advise you not to do so, but it&#39;s up to
you...), just take the time to learn your editor well. learn its plugin/extension/
whatever system, find or write a theme that makes things really easy on you, check
out <a href="https://medium.com/@evnbr/coding-in-color-3a6db2743a1e#.5rffb0gto">semantic highlighting</a>
and give that a shot for a week, find a way to open a terminal in your editor
(because you DO need that) if it&#39;s a graphical editor, learn keybinds, learn
configs, and make it work for you. that sounds like a lot of work put into something
that&#39;s not directly <strong>work</strong>, but it&#39;s work invested in yourself being better
at using your tools.</p>
<p>laurie voss, the cto of npm, said in a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NWo-RIHiEJ4">talk</a>
that one of the most important things you can do is be good at your editor.
he&#39;s obviously right. he&#39;s laurie voss.</p>
<h2 id="use-git">use git</h2>
<p>this should be obvious. but, i mean, really use it. use it enough that you
learn how to use a gitconfig, templates, etc., and try out lots of different
extensions and wrappers for git (like hub, legit, ghcli, etc.). do stuff with
git. get really comfortable with git. it&#39;s important. other version control also
matters sometimes in some businesses but really really really spend some time
learning git.</p>
<h2 id="configs">configs</h2>
<p>(<a href="https://github.com/zacanger/z">like these</a>)</p>
<p>organize yours. store them somewhere, like in a repo. because when your current
computer dies (and it will), it&#39;ll take you weeks to get things feeling decent
if you have to recreate everything manually. granted, most people don&#39;t have
dotfiles nearly as extensive as those, but you don&#39;t need to -- i&#39;m a little bit
of a hoarder. disk space is cheap. whatever.</p>
