<p>Some things will be ongoing tasks, and won&#39;t be checked off until I feel like
I&#39;ve been consistent with them for several months at the least.</p>
<p>I may add things to this list, or remove ones that I&#39;ve straight-up decided were
a bad idea (like buying a car).</p>
<p>The checklist is using GFM, which this blog generator doesn&#39;t understand. (That&#39;s on the list.)</p>
