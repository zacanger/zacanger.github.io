This isn&#39;t news. They <em>can</em> help
other people be more aware of what you&#39;re doing, which is generally a good thing
(collaborating on projects, managers keeping track of progress, whatever), but
overdoing it with the tools can be seriously detrimental to actually getting
anything done.</p>
<p>I was going to write a much longer post about this, but let me just give you a
list of all things I check several times a day (in the case of Slack, several
times an hour), instead.</p>
<ul>
<li>Wrike (a task/project management thing with the worst UI of any like tool on
the market)</li>
<li>Trello (not so much anymore, but some people still use it at work, apparently)</li>
<li>Quip (a weird combination of Trello and Excel)</li>
<li>Github Issues/PRs (Issues not so much anymore, though that would be the most
sensible place to keep track of repo-specific todos)</li>
<li>And of course, Slack</li>
</ul>
<p>Personally I keep track of what I need to do in two places: for personal items,
a JSON file (yes, a JSON file). This means I can use it with my little
<a href="http://npmjs.com/package/lilnote">command-line note-taking app</a>, easily work
with it in any language, whatever. For work tasks, I just keep a giant Markdown
file, using GFM-style task lists. I end up copying things over from one or more
of the above tools into Markdown, where I keep track of them for hours or days
or weeks, then as things are fleshed out, completed, nixed, or whatever, going
back to those tools (usually more than one) to update them.</p>
<p>This is not an efficient workflow. Some of these tools (Quip and Wrike
especially) are so lacking in all the things that make a good project management
app (mainly, simplicity and ease of use) that using them ends up taking more
than half as much time as many of the small tasks.</p>
<p>The last place I worked, we switched to this thing called Droptask. It was so
bad, such a ridiculously complicated UI mess, that myself and some co-workers
just ended up not using it at all, and relied solely on Slack. Picking a (one,
singular) decent tool really makes a difference. Trello&#39;s popular because it&#39;s
simple and easy. For devs, same goes for Issues.</p>
<p>I meant to write a good bit more about this but I probably don&#39;t need to.
Everyone complains about using too many tools all the time, especially devs
using businessy tools. And it&#39;s late. So.</p>
