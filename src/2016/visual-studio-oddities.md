## Story:

Manager: 'Hey there's this thing, can you do it? Shouldn't take long.'

Me: 'Sure, I guess.'

Manager: 'It's in Angular.'

Me: 'Urgh, right, okay, no prob.'

Me: 'In [C# app]?'

Manager: 'Yeah.'

Me: Spends five hours fighting Visual Studio.

True story.

Some Visual Studio oddities:

* undo is ctrl-z, but
* redo is shift-alt-backspace.
* there's no 'revert' (which even basic text editors have)
* shift-tab only works if you have multiple lines selected
* jump-to-matching-symbol (`%` in vim) only works sometimes
* there's no search-in-open-buffers, i think
* commenting out code: `ctrl-k ctrl-c`
* selecting text and hitting quotes will delete the text, not wrap in quotes
* line-numbers are off by default
* menus upon menus upon menus, each one slower than the last

I'm sure it's a really great IDE for C# people, but goddamn, it's slow.

It also has that horrible malware problem where you need to have Windows to use it.
