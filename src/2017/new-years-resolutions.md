I'm re-posting NY resolutions as a checklist, post-dated for the end of this year.

Some things will be ongoing tasks, and won't be checked off until I feel like
I've been consistent with them for several months at the least.

I may add things to this list, but won't delete any.

The checklist is using GFM, which this blog generator doesn't understand. (That's on the list.)

## things i hope to maybe do in 2017

* [ ] Work less at work
  * [ ] Mainly, stop working on weekends and in the middle of the night and stuff
* [ ] Get familiar these languages to write real-world stuff
  * [ ] Racket
  * [ ] ClojureScript
  * [ ] Haskell
* [ ] Learn more about `sh` and POSIX compat in general
  * [ ] Also convert as much of my dotfiles as possible to use `sh` instead of `bash`
  * [ ] Also weed out my dotfiles, they're ridiculous
* [ ] At least record the acoustic album that's been written and sitting there for ages
* [ ] Maybe get Windows working enough to finish up the electro album thing
* [ ] Be healther
  * [ ] Switch to vaping, for real this time
  * [x] Maybe eat better?
    * [x] Less pizza, at least
* [ ] Buy a car
* [ ] Finish paying off debts, so close
  * [x] Also try not to tap into savings so much for stupid things
* [ ] Change how this blog is built, so it's more flexible, and maybe using something fun like Frog (using GFM).
  * [ ] Also, blog more (at least, clear out my `drafts` dir).
* [x] Be making more money
  * [x] Preferably where I am now, but somewhere else if that doesn't work out
  * [x] Also start actually emailing recruiters back
* [ ] Switch to Mutt or some other purely text-based email client
* [ ] Actually finish anything ever
  * [x] Various unfinished small projects
  * [ ] Finish Pharaoh rewrite early on
* [x] Make progress on learning Korean, for real this time
* [x] Try really hard to not write any untested code
* [x] Make a real effort to talk to real humans in real life
* [x] Take the time to move all things using Facebook auth away from this
* [x] Delete Facebook
